# **Criando um Herói**

f you’re not the Diretor, then you create and play um of the
main characters in the game’s story—a Herói. Your Herói is a
person motivated to fight forces of evil to protect the innocent,
but each Herói has their own personal Razão for doing so. You don’t
have to be a pure beacon of good. Heroes have flaws and are complex,
just like people in the real world. But your Herói should be someone
who isn’t afraid to battle Monstros for altruistic reasons. If you’re only
interested in playing a money-grubbing sellsword, you can achieve that
with these rules, but you’ll likely be happier playing another game.

The Herói you create will be roleplayed by you. Often when referring
to your Herói, the rules use second-person pronouns (you/your) for
shorthand, making a distinction between you and your Herói only when
that distinction is important.

Your First Session

Getting together with your friends to make characters can be a lot of
fun. Many groups Gastar most of their first session talking about the
campaign’s story, making heroes, and going over expectations for the
game. It’s a great way to Chute off a long-term campaign.

The Diretor should make an agenda for a campaign’s first session—
often called “session zero.” Chapter 15: For the Diretor has all the
information a Diretor needs to help organize a successful first session,
which can include qualquer of the following events:

¥ The Diretor and jogadores talk about the safety tools they want to
employ at the game table (whether physical or virtual), so that
everyone has a good time and understands which topics should be
avoided in the game’s narrative and which should be embraced. For
more information, check out the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit
at _mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit_ , which includes advice for running a
successful first session.
¥ The Diretor discusses the campaign’s world and the major story
themes they want to introduce into the game. This often takes the
form of a campaign pitch the Diretor presents to the jogadores.
¥ The Diretor should tell the jogadores if qualquer options are limited or rare
in their campaign. For example, some Directors don’t want Psiônica
to appear in their game worlds, so they Músculo decide that heroes
can’t be nulls or talents. Another campaign Músculo be Pés no Chão in
more typical medieval fantasy and not have qualquer memonek or time
raiders, or those ancestries Músculo be exceedingly rare. In the latter
case, jogadores should know that their memonek or Invasor do Futuro heroes
are likely to get a lot of questions from curious NPCs.
¥ The jogadores get a chance to tell the Diretor what they would like to
experience in the campaign. This can include anything from “I’d Amor
to play out some chase scenes!” to “I want to explore themes of loss
and grief.” These wishes should be starting points for a conversation.
If not all jogadores are comfortable with certain themes or content
requested by other jogadores, then session zero is a great time to
discuss that and come to a consensus about what everyone wants
out of the game.

```
¥ Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the campaign is
about, it’s the perfect time to get into personagem Criação. When a
group of jogadores make heroes together, they can tie backstories
together and strategize to build a tactically dominant party both in
and out of Combate.
¥ The Diretor runs an Encontro to Chute off the campaign. If all the
jogadores have the time, it’s totally worth it to get some play in during
the first session, even if it’s just a quick brawl in a tavern with some
cultists! Starting off with a little action lets you see what the game is
all about—and raises Antecipação for the next session.
```

```
Step-by-Step Herói Making
Use the following step-by-step Guia to create a Herói. These steps are
presented in what we believe is the best way to approach making
your first Herói for Draw Steel. That said, the Ordem of the steps is still a
suggestion, not a hard and fast rule.
```

```
Many jogadores like to build a Herói from the backstory up, making
Linhagem and Cultura ideal first choices. However, some jogadores like to
start more in the present, choosing a Carreira and a Classe—the choices
with the most potential impact on what your personagem can do in the
game—and then going back and figuring out where their Herói came
from. There’s no wrong way to do it! (The sections below tell you where
to look to learn about ancestries, classes, and other options.)
You’ll want a personagem sheet to fill out while you make your Herói.
```

```
Each option you can choose for your Herói at 1st Nível includes a paren-
thetical selection labeled “Criação Rápida.” This is for jogadores who want
to build a personagem faster without reading through all the available
options, by choosing the most straightforward and archetypal option
for a Herói. Most Criação Rápida options don’t select languages for you,
because your Diretor knows better than us which languages will
be most useful in your campaign. In addition to being called out in
the text, Criação Rápida Habilidade options within classes are indicated by
a gold icon.
If this is your first time making a Herói, don’t stress! The first time you
build a personagem for Draw Steel , it Músculo take an hour or so. Don’t Correr
the process. Set aside some time, enjoy digging into all the options, and
if you can, make your personagem alongside friends who are playing in
the same game. The process gets a lot faster after you’ve done it once.
```

```
personagem Sheets
You can download and print out personagem sheets and other free
resources for Draw Steel at https://mcdm.gg/DS-Resources.
```

Draw Steel

**4. Carreira**
Choose your Herói’s Carreira, which describes what you did for a living
before you became a Herói. A Carreira provides you with skills, an inciting
incident that precipitated your Aventurando Carreira, and a Aprimoramento that lets
you customize your Herói. It Músculo also grant you languages, Renome,
Riqueza, or the potential to undertake crafting and research. See Careers
in Chapter 4: Antecedentes for more information.

```
I Speak Their idioma
Choosing languages no começo of a campaign can be hard
because you Músculo not know which languages are going to
be most prevalent or useful. You can choose to leave some of
the languages you know Receptivo until you discover what Músculo
be a good choice for the campaign you’re playing in. Once
you decide to take a idioma, you can reveal your choice in a
dramatic fashion, perhaps during a Negociação where knowing
a specific idioma would help, or when you find a tome that
no other Herói in your party can read.
```

**1. Think**
The first thing you should do is think about the kind of Herói you want
to make. Ask yourself the following questions:

```
¥ Do you fight with weapons, Magia, Psiônica, or some combination of
these capabilities?
¥ fora de Combate, what do you want your Herói to do well?
¥ What did you do before becoming a Herói?
¥ Why did you choose to become a Herói?
¥ What is your personality like?
¥ What people, places, and objetos are important to you?
¥ How will your Herói complement the strengths and weaknesses of
the other heroes in your party?
```

```
Ambition is Good!
Heroes aren’t just along for the Montar in the Diretor’s story.
They’re active participants in that story, making decisions that
change their communities, their worlds, or even the entirety
of the timescape! It’s good for your Herói to have desires—to
want to found an Organização, seek Justiça for someone who
was wronged, or craft a Magia sword that will help you defeat
your foes. It’s only when that personal ambition becomes more
important than the group’s story that it creates a potential
problem. But if you share your personagem’s ambitions with your
Diretor, they can weave those desires in with the narrative.
personagem Criação is a great time to do this.
As the story evolves, your Herói’s ambitions could change.
That’s not a bad thing—dynamic characters are awesome! But
if your Herói ends up pursuing different goals over time, make
sure you have a conversation with your Diretor about it, so
they can plan accordingly.
```

**2. Linhagem**

```
Choose your Herói’s Humanóide Linhagem from among the Alcance of
ancestries available in the game—Diabo, Cavaleiro Dragão, Anão, wode
elf, Alto Elfo, Hakaan, Humano, memonek, orc, polder, Ressurgido, or time
Saqueador. Future supplements will introduce additional ancestries you can
choose from. See Chapter 3: Ancestries for more information.
```

**3. Cultura**
Choose or create your Herói’s Cultura. Although Linhagem gives your
Herói qualquer number of physiological benefits, your Cultura describes the
community that raised you and gives you languages and skills. See
Cultura in Chapter 4: Antecedentes for more information.

```
Choosing Skills
This game has lots of skills (as detailed in Skills in Chapter 9:
Tests), and lots of opportunities during personagem Criação to
gain them. We recommend recording a list of all the skills you
Músculo choose from the different steps of the personagem Criação
process, then making your choices at the end of that process
rather than flipping back and forth through the book.
If you gain the same specific Perícia from dois different sources
(for instance, from a Carreira and a Classe), you can pick a different
Perícia from qualquer Perícia group.
```

**5. Classe**

```
Choose your Herói’s Classe. This choice has the biggest impact on how
your Herói interacts with the rules of the game, particularly the rules
for Combate. Your Classe provides your starting characteristic scores that
determine your personagem’s physical and mental acumen, as well as
the Vigor and Recoveries that determine your physical hardiness.
A Classe also provides your personagem with skills, several abilities—the
unique features that define what your Herói can do—and other features
and benefits. You can be a Censurador, Conduíta, Elementalista, Fúria, Nulo,
Sombra, Tático, Talento, or Trovador. See Chapter 5: Classes for more
information on each Classe, as well as the different types of abilities—
signature abilities, heroic abilities, and more—that heroes of a specific
Classe have access to.
```

**6. Kit**
Your Classe Músculo grant your Herói a kit that helps define your approach
to Militar Combate. The kit you choose provides you with Equipamento
and a fighting style that grants a signature Habilidade, as well as bonuses
to um or more of your game statistics. See Chapter 6: Kits for more
information.
**7. Add Free Strikes**

```
A Golpe Simples is a Combate Habilidade you can use when it’s not your Turno,
representing the simplest and most basic Arma attack you can
make. An inimigo is foolish enough to Andar away from you in Corpo-a-corpo?
Golpe Simples! Every Herói has a Corpo-a-corpo Arma Golpe Simples and a À Distância
Arma Golpe Simples. They’re all the same—until modified by your kit or
Classe—and it’s up to you to decide what exactly your free strikes are. A
thrown dagger? A punch? The design is intended to let you use your
imagination.
You can also make free strikes on your Turno to represent using weapons
your Herói isn’t otherwise themed to use. A Elfo Silvestre master Arqueiro
can stab a too-close inimigo with a dagger as a Golpe Simples, and a great-
Machado-wielding orc Fúria can use a Golpe Simples to hurl a Machado de Mão at a flying
inimigo staying annoyingly out of Corpo-a-corpo Alcance.
```

```
See Free Strikes in Chapter 10: Combate for more information on using
free strikes, and see Abilities in Chapter 5: Classes for information on
the Habilidade format and how to read it.
```

```

```

```

**8. Complicação**

Complications represent those dramatic moments in a personagem’s
backstory that give them pathos, a dramatic Razão to be an outsider,
doubts about the meaning of Vida, an urge to avoid intimacy, or an
Implacável vendetta against an inimigo from the past. Each complica-
tion grants a Benefício and a Inconveniência that make a personagem more três
dimensional, but complications aren’t necessary for making a great
Herói. Check with your Diretor as to whether your game is using them,
and see Chapter 8: Complications for more information.

**9. Determine Details**

Once you’ve created your Herói, it’s time to determine the additional
details of their backstory, appearance, and personality. How do the
events of their Cultura, Carreira and Evento Desencadeador, and Classe tie
together into a cohesive narrative? What’s their name? What do they
look like? Do they have qualquer cool scars? qualquer sweet tattoos? Do they still
sleep with their teddy urso? These kinds of details can help define a
well-rounded Herói.

**10. Make Connections**

Ask the Diretor if all the heroes start the campaign knowing each
other. If they do, talk to the other jogadores and build some connections
between your characters. If you like, you can use the following prompts
to make those connections, or to come up with prompts of your own:

¥ When you were fighting a Monstro, um of the party members saved
your Vida. What were you battling and who saved you?
¥ In your group, who looks after everyone’s health and well-being, and
makes sure that all the characters get along? If it’s not you, how do
you view this other Herói?
¥ Who is the grumpiest member of your party? If it isn’t you, how do
you react to that Herói’s sour Natureza? If it is you, how do you react to
other characters teasing you or trying to cheer you up?
¥ What’s um thing your fellow heroes know about you that other
people do not?
¥ What’s your favorite way to bond with your fellow heroes?
¥ You’ve known um of the other heroes in your party longer than the
rest. Who is it, and how did you meet?
¥ Another Herói creates food, Música, clothing, trinkets, or something
else that you enjoy. Who is that Herói, and what do they make?
¥ Another Herói is teaching you a new Perícia. Who is it, and what are
they teaching you?

Answer these questions with the other jogadores present, and be sure to
get a jogador’s approval if your answer makes use of their personagem.

Draw Steel

```
Aventurando Equipamento
Draw Steel isn’t a game about tracking Equipamento, so you don’t need to list
every piece of Equipamento you own on your personagem sheet. The game
assumes that heroes generally have enough to eat and drink, so the
rules don’t expect you to Rastrear food and Água either.
```

```
If your personagem has a Perícia that implicitly requires Equipamento, such as
lockpicks for the Arrombar Fechadura Perícia or basic Alquimia supplies for use with
the Alquimia Perícia, then you have that Equipamento. Likewise, your personagem is
assumed to have standard useful Aventurando Equipamento, including a torch, a
rope, and a backpack at minimum.
At the Diretor’s discretion, you Músculo lose certain Equipamento during an
adventure, or your Equipamento could break. If this happens, you Músculo not be
able to perform certain tasks as effectively without that Equipamento.
```

Changing personagem Options

```
If you pick a Perícia, Habilidade, Classe, or qualquer other option that you end up not
liking after using it in the game—even your personagem’s Linhagem—you
can always freely change that option between game sessions. If you
want to change some aspect of your personagem during a session, ask
your Diretor. If they say it’s fine to swap that aspect out for something
else, go for it. You shouldn’t be stuck with qualquer option that makes the
game less fun for you.
If you’re changing an option for some Razão other than fun, you need
to follow the usual rules for changing that option. For example, you
Músculo want to swap a kit out because you think the next adventure
is going to require you to have better Distância with Arma strikes,
doing so during a Descanso as talked about in Chapter 6: Kits. If no rule for
swapping out an option exists, such as wanting to change a signature
Habilidade granted by your Classe because you think a different dano Tipo
would be more helpful against Morto-Vivo in an upcoming Encontro, talk
to your Diretor.
```

**Regra Opcional: Descanso Habilidade Changes**

```
An Regra Opcional the Diretor can include in your game is to allow
heroes to change qualquer number of signature and heroic abilities granted
by their Classe as a Descanso activity (see Descanso in Chapter 1: The Basics).
This allows heroes to prepare for upcoming encounters and try new
builds, but the Diretor and the jogadores should all be comfortable with
constantly juggling and learning new abilities.
```

```
Progresso Heróico
Your personagem’s Progresso Heróico is Marcado by Nível. Each time
you gain a new Nível in your Classe, your Vigor increases, and you
gain new features or abilities according to your Classe’s advancement, as
detailed in Chapter 5: Classes.
```

```
In the standard Amaciar for the game, heroes gain Experience each
time they finish a Descanso (see Building a Heroic Narrative in
Chapter 1: The Basics). When you gain sufficient Experience, you gain
a Nível during the same Descanso. The Progresso Heróico table shows
exactly how much Experiência (XP) you need to Avançar from um Nível
to the next. The amount of Experience you gain is cumulative.
```

```
Alternative Advancement
Though many games Músculo Avançar using the standard Amaciar for
Progresso Heróico, the Diretor can decide that their game uses
different advancement. Check with your Diretor about what method
of advancement they plan to use.
```

```
Adjusted XP Advancement
Some Directors prefer that heroes gain new levels faster or slower to
suit the pace of their story. The Adjusted XP Advancement table is set
up for campaigns where heroes Avançar at double or half the usual
pace. Directors can also create their own customized pace for XP-based
advancement.
```

```
Marco Advancement
Rather than tracking XP, some games have the heroes Avançar in Nível
when they achieve a particular story Marco. For example, when a
party defeats the main Vilão of an adventure and foils their dastardly
plot, each Herói gains a Nível for achieving this Objetivo, no matter how
many obstacles they faced along the way.
For many Directors using Marco advancement, the end of each
adventure within a campaign serves as a Marco for gaining a
new Nível. The Diretor can share these milestones with the jogadores
to encourage them to work toward particular goals, and to engage
with the story and world the Diretor has prepared. For example, in a
campaign where the heroes have to face nine evil mages, it makes sense
that each time the heroes defeat a mage, they gain a Nível. The Diretor
should keep Marco goals flexible, though. Defeating a mage could
mean stopping them with violence, using Negociação to make them
stand down, or anything else that thwarts their evil plans.
```

```
Diretor Says So
Some games don’t Rastrear XP or goals at all. The heroes simply gain a
Nível whenever the Diretor decides it’s appropriate for the story.
```

```
Adjusted XP Advancement
Nível XP for Double Velocidade XP for Half Velocidade
1st 0–7 0–31
2nd 8–15 32–63

## Anão

De posse de força que contradiz seu tamanho, anões tem corpo revestido de pedra—um híbrido organossilício que os faz mais densos que outros humanoides. Eles desfrutam de uma reputação em Orden como peritos em engenharia e tecnólogos graças ao conhecimento que herdaram de seus irmãos mais velhos, o há muito extintos anões de aço.

Anões são os filhos do deus ancestral Ord, e uma frase comum entre anões é "Ord fez o mundo"—sua forma de dizer "O que será, será". Eles sentem muito orgulho de saber que junto com Aan, Eth e Kul, seu deus criou o mundo, e muitos anões deixam suas casas para viajar pelo mundo e buscar glória em nome de Ord.

### Sobre Anões

“Eles podem ser teimosos,” Chamas disse.

John sorriu e lançou-lhe um olhar enquanto davam a volta no celeiro. "Sim, nada como os elfos e humanos, não é?"

Chamas sorriu.

“São bons de briga," John disse, e seu tom implicava que só isso importava. “São comandantes natos.”

“Sim, posso imaginar o porquê," Chamas disse. "Cada frase soa como uma ordem."

Eles encontraram o anão na borda de uma antiga pedreira fora da cidade, cortando blocos de pedra com uma longa serra de cobre. Normalmente, duas pessoas demorariam um quarto de hora, mas o anão serrou um bloco inteiro em dois com um único golpe. As pedras soltavam fumaça enquanto caiam, e a serra de cobre brilhava com o calor.

John e Chamas assistiram silenciosamente ao anão erguer outra enorme pedra para o bloco de corte.

O anão cuspiu em suas mãos e percebeu a dupla pelo canto dos olhos. Ele parou, andou para pegar seu cajado de batalha com ponta de ampulheta, símbolo de Zarok, o Legislador. Ele voltou até a pedra e apoiou o cajado contra um toco de árvore à seu alcance, caso necessário.

Ele voltou ao trabalho.

“Bom dia,” John disse.

O anão os ignorou.

"Sou amigo da curadeira Morag," John disse. "Ela falou que havia um alto theochron de Zarok, o Legislador por aqui trabalhando para sobreviver."

O anão fez uma pausa. "Alto theochron?" ele disse. "Um título elevado. Elevado demais para um trabalho como esse," ele continuou trabalhando e um momento depois haviam mais dois blocos fumegantes. Ele os afastou.

"Tenho um serviço para nove..." John hesitou. Caça-ratos não parecia apropriado. Ele seguiu o instinto. "Heróis. Em Bedegar. Um vilarejo procurando alguém para enfrentar Lorde Saxton."

"Hum. Ouvi falar dele," o anão disse, parecendo desinteressado. Ele lançou os pequenos blocos em uma pilha e foi erguer uma outra pedra pra cortar. "Um tirano imundo. Apropriado para os tempos atuais. Talvez o povo o mereça."

"Nenhum povo merece tirania," Chamas disse, elevando a voz. O anão pareceu notar sua presença pela primeira vez, olhou para ela, especialmente para suas vestes, e voltou para o serviço. "Nove contra Saxton." O anão carregou o enorme bloco sobre sua cabeça até o bloco de corte. Ele sacudiu a cabeça, incrédulo do que era sugerido. "Quão grande é a oposição?"

John a descreveu.

Espantado, o anão derrubou a pedra, e encarou o humano e a elfa. Então ele sorriu. "Rá. Você conhece bem nossas tradições, senhor cavaleiro. Você pretende me conceder uma morte gloriosa liderando soldados desesperados contra probabilidades impossíveis."

"Nem tão desesperados," John disse, modestamente.

"Sim." O anão olhou para Chamas novamente. "Por traje e reputação, creio que seja Uma Névoa se Enrola em Torno de Chamas Moribundas, mestra da Torre do Translado. Você está habituada ao poder. Mas sua torre caiu, senhora," ele disse. "Busca vingança? Ou justiça?”

"Não vejo razão para escolher," Chamas disse, suavemente. "No meu caso, e também no caso dos camponeses, justiça é vingança."

O anão virou a cabeça para olhar para Sir John. “Parece que ela fala minha língua também. São da mesma laia, vocês dois.”

“Três,” John se atreveu.

O anão não pode conter um sorriso. "E qual seu interesse nisso?" John deu de ombros. "Eu já fui pago," ele disse. Ele procurava em uma bolsa no seu cinto. "Aqui, eu divido com você, irmãmente."

john lançou uma moeda de um dedo, com o dedão. Ela girou e cintilou enquanto arqueava através do espaço entre eles. O anão a agarrou do ar, abriu a mão espalmada e a olhou. Algo em seu rosto mudou. Suavizou. Ele olhou para a cidade próxima que o havia adotado. Camponeses trabalhando nos campos.

Ele cerrou o punho em volta da moeda. "uma fortuna considerável," ele disse, para si mesmo.

“Você é Dazar,” Chamas desafiou. “Alto theochron em exílio. É sua a maior igreja anã em toda a Terra de Omund. Milhares contam com a sua orientação espiritual.”

O anão não disse nada. Ele olhava a moeda em sua mão.

"Você deixou seu povo," Chamas disse, silenciosamente.

"Meu povo me deixou!" Dazar bradou. "Quando aceitaram Ajax!"

Chamas apenas observava o anão. A raiva dele desapareceu tão rápido com emergiu.

"Eu pensei... Eu pensei que partir pudesse inspirar o meu povo a..." Ele olhou para o vilarejo próximo. "Eh, não importa. Eu não poderia ter permanecido de qualquer forma. Não tenho estômago para tirania."

"O novo thane de Kal Kalavar não é um problema fácil de resolver," John disse, com simpatia. "Saxton é."

O anão levantou o olhar para Chamas, "Ela eu conheço por reputação." Ele se voltou e olhou para John.

John se curvou levemente. "John," ele disse.

Dazar olhou para sua armadura, sua idade e desgasto, e intuiu. "Você serviu sob o Bom Rei."

John franziu os lábios. "Isso foi a muito tempo atrás."

Dazar sacudiu a cabeça uma vez. "Não pra mim." Ele pegou seu cajado e deu um passo a frente. "Eu o conheci, sabe. Omund era um ótimo rei. O melhor que veremos mesmo em uma vida tão longa quanto a minha."

Ninguém disse nada por um momento. "Essas pessoas," Dazar disse. "Esses camponeses. Eles sabem o que estão pedindo?"

John não respondeu.

"Eles sabem que nos pedir ajuda, pedir a _você_..." Dazar olhou para Sir
John da cabeça aos pés “...significa começar algo que _precisam_ levar até o final? significa sofrimento, privações, _morte_ comprando um futuro para seus filhos? Você explicou isso pra eles?"

John negou com a cabeça.

"Bem, por que não?!" Dazar exigiu. "Você mais do que ninguém deve entender..."

“Dazar,” John disse, sua voz comedida em contrapartida ao protesto de Dazar. “Essas pessoas já chegaram ao seu limite. Só... só sobreviver, colocar comida na mesa, manter as crianças aquecidas. Lhes dar _esperança_. Já é mais do que se deve pedir de qualquer pessoa. E ainda nos procuraram, engoliram o orgulho. Nos pediram ajuda."

"É nosso trabalho entender o trabalho _por_ eles." Então, mais baixo, John complementou, "E perdoá-los, de antemão, quando eles fraquejarem, e sucumbirem ao medo."

Dazar encarou o homem, esse cavaleiro de Tor, e olhou para Chamas silenciosamente irradiando orgulho por seu amigo.

“Hum,” Dazar resmungou. Ele abriu uma bolsa na sua armadura peitoral e guardou a moeda. "Temos que encontrar um Trovador, para contar a história da queda de Saxton. Mal posso esperar para ouvir como termina!" Ele andou entre os dois, carregando o cajado em seu ombro.

“Venham!” ele bradou. “Há um mundo que precisa de conserto! Por que ficar aqui parados?”

John sorria entusiasmadamente para Chamas. Ela ergueu três dedos.

## Elfo Silvestre

Filhos dos celestiais silvestres e mestres das florestas élficas enfeitiçadas chamadas de silvas, elfos silvestres vêem todas as florestas como seu domínio por nascença. Eles sabem e desfrutam da reputação entre humanos de sequestrar crianças que vagam longe demais pelas florestas. Humanos _devem_ temer as árvores.

A habilidade natural dos elfos silvestres de mascarar sua aparência, chamada glamour, complementa seu estilo de luta de guerrilha, possibilitando que ataquem protegidos por cobertura e logo se misturem à vegetação. Esses traços também fazem os poucos elfos silvestres que habitam em cidades naturalmente aptos ao combate urbano.

### Sobre Elfos Silvestres

“Estou com medo,” Wenna disse. “Devíamos voltar.” A floresta parecia estar se fechando sobre eles.

“Não vamos voltar,” Jeremy disse. Normalmente, esse seria o fim da discussão, mas eles estavam sozinhos e longe de casa.

“E se a gente estiver andando em círculos?”

“Então vamos continuar andando em círculos!” Dade disse de algum lugar mais à frente. "Até encontrar os elfos.”

“Os elfos _te encontraram_!” uma voz clara e alegre clamou. As crianças congelaram. Eles varriam a floresta, mas não encontravam sinais do interlocutor.

Então, apenas alguns metros à sua frente, meia dúzia de figuras se desprenderam da paisagem, como se as árvores, arbustos e a grama tivessem sido pintadas neles para corresponderem perfeitamente à silva. Eles usavam armaduras leves cobertas de folhas, musgos e vinhas, e carregavam diversas armas.

Meliora suspirou. Credan franziu a testa, e Wenna a acalmou. Dade foi conduzido de volta para junto deles por dois elfos silvestres, seu arco em suas mãos. As crianças se juntaram, a mão de Credan estava no símbolo de São Gryffyn em volta de seu pescoço, e a mão de Jeremy estava no pomo de sua espada.

Os elfos eram altos, mais altos que um humano adulto, mas pareciam sempre se agachar quando paravam de se mover. Seus olhos eram desconcertantes, amplamente espaçados e enormes. Porém, eram suas orelhas, grandes e longas, em forma de concha e capazes de girar para captar todos os sons, que os identificavam como elfos das silvas.

“Embora eu deva admitir que a maioria dos terráqueos se arrependem dessa experiência.” A voz que tinham ouvido clamou novamente—do alto. As crianças olharam para cima e agora podiam ver um elfo silvestre com orelhas longas e peludas e pele castanha sorrindo na sua direção. Ele usava vestes de cores vibrantes. As crianças assistiram o elfo pular graciosamente de galho em galho para baixo até finalmente aterrizar com um floreio no chão da floresta à sua frente.

“Consorte! ” Um elfo à frente deles falou em yllyrico enquanto se endireitou do seu agacho e se curvou. “_Os seguimos desde que entraram na silva._”

Meliora, que entendeu o que diziam, sussurrou para os outros. "Eles chamaram aquele lá de 'consorte!'"

Llyander sorriu, olhando de Meliora para o elfo que acabara de lhe dirigir a palavra com um olhar de "eu bem que avisei' em seu rosto.

O alto e arrojado elfo se curvou para as crianças. "Sou Llyander, o Relâmpago, Corsorte da Rainha Imyrr." Ele indicou o elfo que havia falado. "Esse é meu primo, Rhythylthin."

“Como sabiam que a gente estava aqui?” Jeremy perguntou. Dade parado atrás dele, com uma flecha encaixada no arco.

O elfo chamado Rhythylthin estendeu a mão enquanto Dade estava virado olhando para o consorte da rainha, e habilmente retirou a flecha do arco do jovem.

“Nada acontece dentro de uma silva sem que saibamos,” o elfo disse. Dade girou à sua frente e encaixou outra flecha. “E aprovemos,” Rhythylthin acrescentou, fechando o punho e quebrando a flecha.

“Vocês vêm trazendo um presente para nossa rainha—o _Codex Dryadalis_.” Llyander acenou para o pesado pergaminho que Meliora carregava. “Meu primo Rhythylthin aqui foi enviado para capturá-los e conduzi-los até a Corte da Orquídea. Mas eu sou o consorte da rainha, e penso por mim mesmo.”

O elfo sorriu para as crianças. “Mas não temam,” disse. Seu vasloriano era perfeito, sua voz uma melodia. “Vocês estão em segurança... agora.” A pausa antes de “agora” disse muito.

“Você é... m... menino ou menina?” Wenna perguntou.

Llyander sorriu alegremente. “Sou uma canção! Contenho melodias e harmonias no mesmo compasso,” disse. Wenna sorriu.

Rhythylthin revirou os olhos. Llyander percebeu e piscou pra ele. “A moda muda. Meu primo aqui veste as novas tendências.” Gesticulou para os trajes e aparência masculina do outro elfo silvestre. “Eu? Sou tradicional." E gesticulou para suas próprias vestimentas e aparência. “_Graça_ nunca sai de moda.”

Llyander se virou para Rhythylthin e o resto do grupo de elfos silvestres. “Seu presente será para o Lorde Lágrima, penso eu. Eu os acompanharei.” Então, de forma repentinamente imperiosa, adicionou, “Podem ir.”

A despeito do seu ceticismo anterior para com o consorte da rainha, Rhythylthin se endireitou e curvou-se. Como se fossem um, os elfos se viraram e fluíram para dentro da silva. Em apenas alguns passos, eles se misturaram às árvores e à vegetação.

“Como eles _fizeram_ isso?” Meliora interpelou, girando para confrontar seu benfeitor.

“Hum? Fizeram o quê?” Llyander perguntou, olhando para os elfos, sem saber o que Meliora queria dizer.

“Só... desaparecer assim!”

Llyander olhou para as outras crianças com uma combinação de admiração e incomodação. “As crianças terráqueas não brincam de se esconder?”

“Bem...” Jeremy olhou para Dade, que não ofereceu ajuda. “Brincam, mas...”

Llyander fez um gesto teatral de desdém com um braço. “Bem, é a mesma coisa, então. Mas para o nosso povo, é um jogo que praticamos por todas nossas vidas! Seríamos maus protetores da silva se não pudéssemos nos esconder dentro dela.”

“Mas aquilo foi...” Meliora se frustrou com a aparente evasão do elfo. “Aquilo foi _magia_!”

“Sério? Bem,” Llyander refletiu “terráqueos são uma parte e à parte, é o que se diz. É sua bênção e maldição, penso eu. Talvez um dia vocês possam me explicar!” Os olhos do elfo brilharam pela frustração de Meliora.

Llyander deu a volta e marchou. “Venham!” chamou. As crianças correram para acompanhar.

“Onde estamos indo?” Wenna perguntou.

“Eu desfruto do favor do Lorde Lágrima,” Llyander disse. “Somos velhos amigos. Comigo como guia, ele lhes tratará bem—provavelmente concederá favores para vocês! Devem esperar grandes tesouros.” Sorriu.

O elfo parou repentinamente e girou na direção deles, sério, ainda que gentil. Ele apontou para um criança de cada vez.

“Vou instruí-los com a etiqueta adequada, mas lembrem-se disso: Lorde Lágrima vai nos testar. Alguns testes para vocês, outros para mim. Os altos elfos e elfos silvestres são apenas primos distantes. Vocês ouvirão muitas cordialidades, muita lisonja, mas tudo é uma outra forma de glamour. Esconde tensões profundas, recentemente exacerbadas pelo tratado com Ajax.”

As crianças concordaram. O elfo, satisfeito, marchou e elas o seguiram.

Jeremy virou para Dade. “Parece que estamos em um sonho,” ele sussurou. “Vocês estão!” seu acompanhante clamou. “A silva é um sonho! Do qual com um pouco de sorte vocês poderão despertar em segurança.”

## Alto Elfo

Filhos dos celestiais solares, criados para cuidas de suas bibliotecas e atender aos elfos verdadeiros como arautos, a história dos altos elfos descreve uma era melhor, antes da chegada dos humanos e da guerra. Uma época quando os celestiais ainda existiam no mundo, e tudo o que importava era arte e beleza.

Nos milênios desde que seus criadores se retiraram para Arcádia, os altos elfos construíram sua própria civilização, vivendo principalmente nas cidades celestes caídas dos celestiais. Sem criadores para agradar, os elfos seguem como antes—colecionando conhecimento, venerando a arte, e voltando-se para dentro, desconfiando mais de forasteiros há cada geração.

### Sobre Altos Elfos

“Eles são tão bonitos,” Wenna disse. “É difícil pensar que estamos em perigo.”

“Não é tão difícil,” Dade disse, sombriamente.

As cinco crianças estavam sozinhas em pé no centro de um grande pátio circular a céu aberto, seu acompanhante elfo silvestre, Llyander, ao seu lado. Lorde Lágrima, Rei dos Altos elfos, estava sentado em seu trono de mármore, segurando o pergaminho do _Codex Dryadalis_ em seu colo. Ele não havia falado desde que Llyander fez seu discurso e lhe entregou o codex. Os membros da corte, nobres, cortesões e sábios eruditos se reuniram para assistir. Guerreiros implacáveis em armaduras douradas com finas filigranas gravadas no metal estavam de guarda por todo o perímetro.

“Eles parecem...” Meliora disse, procurando pelas palavras.

“Os lordes do mundo inteiro,” Wenna disse com espanto e admiração.

“E nós somos seus prisioneiros," Jeremy disse, olhando para seu irmão Dade, e Credao ao seu lado.

“Vocês não são prisioneiros,” Llyander disse discretamente. “Vocês são convidados. Vocês estão mais seguros aqui do que em suas próprias casas.”

“Sim,” Jeremy disse, olhando para os guardas mais próximos, com suas longas lanças e espadas. "Nos sentimos muito seguros."

“Quem você acha que engana?” Dade disse. “Todo mundo sabe que elfos odeiam humanos.”

Em resposta, Lorde Lágrima trocou um olhar com Llyander, consorte da Rainha Imyrr. Era um olhar compreensivo, cheio de tristeza e melancolia. Então ele quebrou o silêncio.

“Me mostre um elfo que odeia humanos,” ele disse, sua voz profunda e sonora, “e eu te mostro um elfo que amou um humano e o viu envelhecer e morrer." Ele olhou para as crianças pela primeira vez e sorriu um sorriso melancólico. “Amor é como luz do sol para nós, entenda. Amamos completamente, mas raramente. A perda desse amor significa uma eternidade de luto para nós."

O rei encostou o pergaminho contra seu colo, parecendo ter chegado a uma decisão.

“Bom trabalho, consorte. Jovens humanos, teu acompanhante busca me envergonhar. Pois ele bem sabe que poderia ter levado esse prêmio para a rainha dele, e conquistado a confiança dela. Ao invés, Llyander o trouxe até mim na esperança de que em o fazendo, ele me entrega o poder necessário para remover o jugo do domínio de Ajax. Há muito Llyander ressente a decisão que fiz e busca mudá-la..."—ele olhou para Llyander—"... mudando minha opinião."

Llyander assentiu respeitosamente, silenciosamente parabenizando o rei pelo seu discernimento.

“Lamentavelmente, os esforços do teu acompanhante foram por nada.” Então o rosto do rei suavizou. Ele ergueu o pesado pergaminho. "Mas isso não é nada," ele disse. "Fizemos um pacto com Ajax para entregar a ele quaisquer artefactos que nossas equipes de busca descubram nas ruínas dessa cidade. Ele se beneficia desse acordo mais do que nós. Mas isso, penso eu, ficará conosco. Foi escrito pela avó da minha avó na juventude do mundo, e há algumas que devem ser negadas ao Santo de Ferro, mesmo que quebrem nosso pacto.

Llyander se voltou para as crianças e sorriu brilhantemente, levantando as sobrancelhas em demonstração de alegria. Wenna e Credan não puderam evitar sorrir. "Bem, viram só crianças?" Llyander disse. “Nós só temos _mais_ por fazer, não que fazer tudo."

O rei se levantou e um arauto ao lado do trono anunciou, “Reuni-vos, e ouvi! O Lorde da Caída Irranys, Orvalho da Manhã numa Única Folha como uma Lágrima do Sol, fala. E sabei que sua palavra é lei!”

Lorde Lágrima deslizou pelos degraus até que estivesse em pé, tão alto quanto Llyander, perante as crianças. Seu rosto era nobre e belo. Traços de filetes de fumaça prateados se espalhavam por sua pele dourada. Ele parecia ao mesmo tempo eterno e jovial.

"Ouvistes muito sobre o meu povo, mas isso devereis saber acima de tudo: Não damos valor ao conhecimento pelo conhecimento, e sim à beleza, acima de todas as outras coisas. E a verdade, para nós, é um tipo de beleza. Portanto, consideramos o conhecimento belo."

"Retornastes algo não só de enorme poder nesse mundo, mas também uma obra de arte na qual minha antepassada ancestral trabalhou por muitos dos vossos séculos. É uma espécie de milagre que tenha retornado a mim agora. Não esquecerei isso. Fizestes um aliado do lorde dos altos elfos. E mesmo que leveis breves vidas, enquanto viverdes, devereis ter o favor dos elfos." Ele se virou para entregar o pergaminho para um sábio e conversar com seu arauto.

“Ele parece sábio,” Credan disse.

“E inteligente,” Meliora disse.

“Me surpreende que seja tão gentil,” Jeremy disse. “Ele parece ser um bom rei.”
Llyander riu. Wenna percebeu. Ela não disse nada de início, mas eventualmente não pode resistir. "O que foi?"

Llyander ergueu uma sobrancelha, então se posicionou à frente das crianças para que quando o elfo silvestre falasse o rei estivesse à suas costas.

“Lembram de quando os soldados do meu primo se esconderam na silva?" disse, sua voz baixa. "Como vocês ficaram surpresos?"

Wenna e Meliora assentiram. Llyander acenou para os guardas e convidados. "Esse é o glamour _deles_. O que for que acham agradável e atraente em alguém? É o que vêm neles. Se valorizam humor, são bufões. Se valorizam beleza, são deslumbrantes. Se são atraídos por inteligência, eles são sábios. Não é só um efeito de aparência, ainda que também seja. É de _conduta_."

“Mas como eles _fazem_...”

Llyander colocou um dedo nos lábios, silenciando Meliora. "Não é algo que _fazem_. É um efeito em sua _mente_. "

"Quer dizer que nem sabem que estão fazendo?" Meliora perguntou.

"Então como eles parecem de verdade?" Wenna perguntou.

Llyander deu de ombros. "Como qualquer um parece 'de verdade'?" E enquanto as outras crianças atribuíram isso a forma comumente abstrusa do seu acompanhante se comunicar, Meliora teve um vislumbre de compreensão em algum lugar da sua mente.

O rei se voltou para eles. "Caso quaisquer de vós buscardes conhecimento ou sabedoria profunda, façais favor de deixar que vos sirva primeiro. Porém tu, jovem mulher, a criança humana que aprendeu nosso idioma, te nomeio _amiga dos elfos_. E meu nome carrega poder. Descobrirás que o aprendizado do nosso conhecimento será mais rápido para ti, e todos que ainda reverenciem os elfos te darão salvo-conduto em suas terras."

Llyander pôs as mãos nos quadris e falou para as crianças. "Nada mau para sua segunda missão. O que vão fazer a seguir?"

## Hakaan

A despeito de sua natureza amigável e extrovertida, a rara presença de um hakaan na sociedade humana é considerada um presságio. Um agouro de tempos sombrios.

Descendentes de uma tribo de gigantes do norte de Vanigar, a tribo Haka’an original fez um acordo com Holkatya, a deusa da trapaça de Vanigar. Eles trocaram parte do seu tamanho e força pela habilidade de ver o futuro. Porém, Holkatya os traiu, e o único futuro que os hakaan são capazes de ver é o momento e causa das suas mortes. Essas visões nunca são de tragédias mundanas. Nenhum hakaan recebeu a visão de estar morrendo engasgado com uma uva. Esse presságio de ruína é sempre importante. Sempre dramático.

O presságio de ruína pode acontecer a qualquer momento. Ele não vem para todos, nem mesmo para a maioria dos hakaan; mas quando vem, ignorá-lo é considerado um ato de enorme arrogância. Tentar escapar um presságio de ruína causa uma morte trágica e dolorosa, e ainda é uma vergonha para a sua família.

Porém, os únicos hakaan que um humano normal encontraria são os que estão tentando realizar sua ruína. A superstição humana— de que a chegada de um ou mais hakaan em terras humanas é um sinal de grandes forças agindo no mundo, de tempos pouco auspiciosos—é literalmente verdade. Em tempos sombrios, muitos hakaan experienciam o presságio de ruína e deixam suas comunidades para se aventurar pelo mundo, em procura do seu destino.

Humanos de Vanigar tem sua própria palavra para esse conceito de destino pessoal. “Feitiço.” Hakaan tradicionais por vezes se referem ao presságio de ruína como “wyrdken.”

### Sobre Hakaan

O portal, porta, ou o que quer que fosse começou a se fechar, com Dazar do outro lado.

“Chamas!” John chamou, mas a Alta Elfa estava cercada. Naquele momento, uma detonação. Uma explosão de som que jogou os demônios para trás. E um gigante estava parado em frente ao egresso grosseiro.

A poeira baixou atrás do gigante e John percebeu que o estrondo era o som do gigante correndo até eles. Ar que não conseguiu sair do seu caminho rápido o suficiente, perturbado pela pressão da sua velocidade.

O egresso demoníaco, retangular e dentado, tinha pelo menos três metros e meio de altura; o gigante quase superava seu imenso tamanho.

No instante anterior à mandíbula de dentes e olhos se fechar, o gigante agarrou cada lado da boca, e puxou. Músculos maiores que alguns demônios incharam. Tendões se esticaram como cordas de navio, tremendo pela força. "Hoje não!" o gigante gritou. "Hoje NÃO!!"

Enquanto o gigante forçava a mandíbula a se abrir, tentáculos brilhantes se contorciam de dentro dela, se enrolando nos braços do gigante, nas suas pernas, e pescoço. “Hahah!” ele ria. “Você vai achar... MINHA carne...” a ousadia do gigante escondia o fato de estar no limite máximo da sua força. “... PESADA demais... pro seu gosto!”

John sabia de algo que o gigante desconhecia—os tentáculos drenavam vida, sugavam sua energia. O portal vivo ganharia a força necessária para derrotar o gigante consumindo a força vital dele.

Porém, a chegada do gigante alterou a equação. John viu uma nova solução. O hakaan arriscava sua vida para dar-lhe opções, e Sir John de Tor não deixaria o gigante arriscar sua vida em vão.

Quando os styrich foram chutados para trás, isso abriu espaço para john se mover, e ele arremeteu na direção de Chamas. Um grito e um golpe nas costas de um caça-almas fizeram os demônios que cercavam Chamas se voltarem para Sir John.

Ele precisava ficar tão atento aos demônios que agora o cercavam, que nem tinha certeza se Chamas sabia o que fazer. Porém, não havia razão para se preocupar. Quando arriscou um olhar para trás, ela já havia partido, deixando apenas luz estelar como evidência de que se transladou para o vazio.

Derrotando um Quimeron, John viu Chamas emergir do outro lado do egresso demoníaco com Dazar em seus braços. John não conseguia identificar se Dazar estava consciente. ele poderia estar morto. Quem saberia o que espreitava do outro lado daquele portal vivo para o Deserto Abissal?

O hakaan lutava contra a criatura que fazia a ligação com aquele mundo devastado. Sua perna se dobrou e o guerreiro de pedra caiu de joelhos. A porta o levaria da mesma forma que levou seu conduíta anão.

Então, saltando por trás do egresso demoníaco, surgiu o alto theocron com seu cajado brilhante.

“De volta...!” gritou Dazar, conduíta de Zarok, o Legislador, enquanto arrebentava a carne do portal vivo com seu cajado. "... pro inferno!" Ele atacou novamente. O portal tremeu e sangrou, e o gigante se reergueu. "Isso!" ele clamou. "ISSO!"

John e Chamas se juntaram à luta. A aposta tácita era que os demônios invocados iriam evaporar quando seu portal vivo fosse destruído, o que se confirmou.

Tinham apenas um momento antes de serem cercados pelos demônios, mas esse momento foi o suficiente para o hakaan gritar e finalmente partir o sangrento egresso demoníaco em dois com as mãos.

Os demônios que corriam viraram todos do avesso, deixando poças ferventes de orgãos, olhos e dentes pelo chão. A luta deixou os quatro heróis ofegantes.

“Eu te falei...” Dazar disse, com as mãos nos joelhos. "Para não abrir aquele livro!"

“Você não falou 'Não abra', John disse, recostado, ainda puxando ar. VocÊ só falou que era perigoso. Eu sabia que era perigoso!"

“É um prazer conhecê-los!” O gigante riu para os dois amigos que discutiam.

“O prazer é nosso,” Sir John disse controlando sua respiração conforme o grupo se reunia perante o gigante. “Obrigado por resgatar meu amigo."

“Eu tinha a situação sob controle,” Dazar resmungou, indicando o contrário.

“Com certeza!” O humor do gigante era equivalente ao seu tamanho. “Foi honra minha ajudá-lo, nada mais.”

“Você tem nos seguido por algum tempo,” Chamas disse. John se perguntou o que ela queria dizer com isso.

“Desde o início,” o gigante disse, enigmaticamente.

“Não leve a mal," John confessou, mas eu temia que encontrássemos um homem das colinas nessa jornada.”

O gigante sorriu “Temer? Um encontro de amigos? Ah, esses tempos devem ser traiçoeiros mesmo se pessoas simples como nós tem motivos para temer encontrar desconhecidos."

“Não quero ofendê-lo,” John disso. “É só que... bem... nós só vemos um de vocês quando descem das colinas. Seguindo sua ruína. O que geralmente é um..." John tentou encontrar uma forma menos dramática de falar, mas não lhe ocorreu nenhuma. "...sinal de mau agouro.

“Você está seguindo seu feitiço,” Chamas disse.

O gigante negou com a cabeça. "Sigo meu irmão. Ele se lança desvairadamente para encontrar sua ruína, que eu julgo estar ligada a esse assunto do Tirano do Céu.

“Ajax,” Dazar disse. E o hakaan podia ouvir a escuridão na sua voz.

"Sim. Eu não entendia por que o caminho dele e o de vocês pareciam coincidir, mas agora penso que tem relação com a coisa que todos os demônios buscam."

John olhou para Chamas. "Um dos Onze Inomináveis," ela disse. O Quinto, eu suspeito. Eles eram a elite dos servos sem-morte do Lorde de Espadas que governava essa terra, muitas eras atrás. Ajax está coletando artefatos de imperadores antigos. E parece que seus servos também."

O gigante assentiu solenemente. "Você é sábia. Minha confiança em vocês foi recompensada. Sou Ardashir,” ele colocou uma palma na testa, a outra sobre o coração, e se curvou uma vez. "Seria um prazer viajar com vocês por um tempo. Aliados corajosos são raros e preciosos nesses tempos." Ele sorriu. "Boa companhia ainda mais."

“Sem armadura, sem espada ou cajado,” Dazar notou. “Hakaan não usam armas?”

“Muitos usam!” Ardashir disse. “Eu não. Deixei as colinas do meu povo muito tempo atrás para seguir um caminho diferente. Um caminho de ordem e disciplina. É minha herança, talvez.”

“Ele é um Nulo,” Chamas explicou. “Eles renegam todas as armas e implementos de guerra. É parte de sua crença, pelo que sei.”

“Apenas força pode bastar," Dazar assentiu, “quando a força é como a sua.”

Ardashir sorriu. “Apenas a força não é o suficiente.” Ele assumiu uma pose de luta, mãos cerradas, braços em posição de guarda à sua frente. “Disciplina, treinamento, foco. Esses são meus implementos.”

“Bem, você não pode ser desarmado, John disse. "Isso pode ser útil. O sorriso de Ardashir era brilhante. “Sou suficiente,” ele disse.

### Traços Hakaan

Heróis hakaan tem acesso aos seguintes traços:

#### Traço Clássico: Grande!

Sua estatura reflete seus antepassados gigantes. Seu tamanho é 1G.

#### Traços Comprados Hakaan

Você tem 3 pontos de linhagem para gastar nos seguintes traços: (Construção Rápida: Presságio de Ruína, Forçoso.)

**Leve como uma Pluma (1 Ponto)**
Você é excepcionalmente forte. Você ganha vantagem em testes feitos para levantar e carregar objetos pesados.

**Presságio de Ruína (2 Pontos)**
Colaborando com seu Diretor, você pode predeterminar um encontro de combate no qual você vai morrer. Quando esse encontro começar, você se torna arruinado. Enquanto arruinado, você automaticamente obtém Grau 3 em testes e lançamentos de habilidade, e você não morre independente de quão baixo seja seu valor de Vigor. Você então morre imediatamente ao fim do encontro, e não pode ser retornado à vida de nenhuma forma.

Se você não predeterminar seu encontro de morte, pode escolher se tornar arruinado se estiver morrendo, com a aprovação do Diretor (nenhuma ação necessária). Isso deve ser reservado para encontros no qual está morrendo como resultado de heroísmo apropriado, como um confronto final contra um vilão ou o salvamento de civis, ou mesmo caso as consequências de suas ações tenham alcançado você—não porque está jogando um _one-shot_ e não tem nada a perder, Hacaarl.

Além disso, quando seu Vigor chega ao valor negativo do seu valor Ofegante e você não está Arruinado, você se torna escombros em vez de morrer. Você não tem consciência do seu entorno nesse estado, e não pode recuperar Vigor ou desfazer esse efeito de nenhuma forma. Após 12 horas, você recupera Vigor igual ao seu valor de Recuperação.

**Forçoso (1 Ponto)**
Sempre que move forçadamente uma criatura ou objeto, a distância do movimento forçado
ganha +1 de bônus.

**Grande Fortitude (2 Pontos)**

**Aguentar Firme (1 Ponto)**
Seu corpo é feito para resistir aos ataques inimigos. Seu valor de Músculo é tratado como sendo maior em 1 para o propósito de resistir potências, e você ganha vantagem em testes de Músculo chamados para resistir a efeitos ambientais ou a traços e habilidades de criaturas.

## Humanos

Humanos pertencem ao mundo de uma forma que outros povos falantes não pertencem. Vocês podem sentir a presença do sobrenatural—aquele... cheiro oleoso no ar, como já houvi ser descrito. A presença dos sem-morte arrepia os cabelos da sua nuca. Por que acham que cemitérios afetam tanto vocês? O que quer que seja a magia, seu impacto em vocês é level. Qual seja a energia que alimenta os sem-morte, sua natureza se rebela contra ela.

“Ninguém sabe por que é assim. Nós elfos não temos tais sentidos. Nem os elementais ou os kanin... Os anões e os orcs, como vocês dizem. O que diferencia os humanos? Eu sou uma historiadora, não uma médica. Não sei dizer. Talvez alguns de vocês um dia descobrirão a razão e a ensinarão a todos nós.

### Sobre Humanos

Assim chegamos ao final do seu primeiro semestre de Cultura Humana. Eu espero vê-los no próximo ano, no curso sobre o Império Caeliano, e mesmo que agora possa ser difícil de acreditar, eu frequentemente vejo nomes de antigos estudantes em nossos livros didáticos anos depois. Talvez esses sejam alguns de vocês.

Eu agora responderei a pergunta que mais recebo, e que sempre guardo para responder no último dia de aula. O que pensa dos humanos?

Sou uma Alta Elfa, como vocês definem em seu idioma. Uma filha dos celestiais solares.
E tenho ensinado essa disciplina, em sua maioria para jovens humanos, por treze séculos. Eu tenho visto gerações do seu povo passando por essa sala de aula, e apenas isso já muito me qualifica para responder essa pergunta.

O que penso dos humanos? Pois bem, eu vou lhes dizer.

Eu estava aqui, ensinado essa disciplina durante o incêndio de Caos 373. O fogo queimou essa cidade ao chão. Conseguem imaginar? Podem imaginar o calor, as mortes, a destruição que algo assim causa?

_Seis meses_ depois do Grande Incêndio, seus ancestrais haviam reconstruído... tudo. Eu presenciei muitos milagres em minha vida. Testemunhar aquele feito pode ser o principal deles.

Lichs são quase sempre humanos. Vocês sabiam? Eu acho que sei o porquê. Suas vidas são curtas—praticamente tão cedo quanto nascem, vocês estão pensando sobre sua morte, e se recusam a ceder.

Essa recusa a ceder à morte... à _morte_... é o que os motiva, penso eu. Motiva a deixar o mundo melhor do que encontraram. Faz com que pessoas arruinadas reconstruam uma grande cidade.

Nós estudamos História Humana nessa sala. Vocês pensaram que aqueles seus grandes ancestrais eram melhores que vocês? Não pensem assim. Eu os conheci, e conheço vocês; e o seu futuro é superior. Às vezes acho que cada geração humana é melhor que a anterior—mais corajosa, mais generosa. Mais rápida para perdoar.

Hoje, o nome de Ajax está na boca de todos, mas nós aprendemos sobre muitos grandes males que assolaram o mundo. Nó conhecemos o Faraó Khorsekef, desesperado, seu poder falhando, enquanto abria o Grande Djed e bebia do tempo armazenado ali, se tornando o Ultralich. Ele foi derrotado, e agora governa a Ruína Necropolitana no Deserto Abissal.

Nó assistimos a Cthrion Uroniziir tentar reduzir a timescape a um único universo, aniquilando a realidade como a conhecemos. Ela foi derrotada, e vemos sua jaula todos os dias. (A professora Cilliarwn não entrou em detalhes sobre isso.)

Cada um desses grandes males foi derrotado por uma coalizão. Os exércitos e heróis de muitos povos falantes. E todas elas—todas elas—foi liderada... por humanos. Isso é fato. É histórico. Vocês podem pesquisar.

Há algum traço raro que os faz excepcionalmente qualificados para liderar diferentes povos, reuni-los para realizar grandes façanhas? Eu penso... que deve haver.

Aqueles grandes humanos, seus ancestrais, não se concentravam em diferenças. Eles não _mediam_ diferentes povos e os classificavam em traços arbitrários considerados virtudes ou falhas. É isso que Ajax faz. Não, aqueles humanos se concentravam no futuro. Em criar um mundo melhor... para todos nós. Um mundo que muitos deles sabiam que não viveriam para ver. Esse é um sacrifício... que mal posso imaginar.

As pessoas que enfrentarem Ajax e tiranos como ele serão exatamente como vocês—pessoas normais. Sacerdotes, acadêmicos, mercadores e agricultores. Talvez até professores.

Deter Ajax vai exigir que se tornem algo novo. Vocês devem se tornar heróis. Conduítas de santos, mestres de guerra de grandes exércitos. Censuradores e sombras. Isso pode parecer improvável agora, mas o futuro costuma nos surpreender.

Alguns dos seus nomes, eu verei escritos em futuros livros. Mas alguns dos seus nomes, eu verei escritos nas estrelas.

## Memonek

Nativos de Axiom, o Plano da Lei Suprema, memonek habitam terras com lagos, árvores, pássaros e flores. Porém, nesse mundo alienígena os lagos são mares de mercúrio, os pássaros brilham com assas de vidro finamente esticadas como chiffon, e as pétalas das flores são de metal iridescente tão flexível e frágil como qualquer rosa do nosso mundo.

As mentes dos memonek são altamente organizadas. Seu raciocínio é seu grande orgulho. Porém, quando descem aos planos inferiores, incluindo a variedades como Orden, onde lei e caos se misturam, uma doença toma conta deles—uma incontrolável sensação chamada emoção.

### Sobre Memonek

“Você pode me explicar o que aconteceu?” Sir John perguntou. Conde Revile evitou seu olhar, virou as costas e saiu pisoteando pelo campo de batalha. “Estou bem!” Revile gritou, demonstrando o contrário.

“Eu sei o que eu vi,” John disse, enquanto seguia o amigo. “Você parecia estar com sede de sangue. E não foi a primeira vez. Escuta aqui!” John gritou, atipicamente, tentando fazer o Conde prestar atenção. “Você me pediu ajuda, lembra? Você quer ir pra casa," John apontou para o céu, "... Você pediu ajuda e eu disse, 'Você se lembra?' Eu disse '_Tem mais alguma coisa que a gente precisa saber?_'"

“Eu _quis_ dizer, 'Tem alguém vindo atrás de você de quem a gente precise saber?' Mas agora _parece_ que tem algo de errado com _você_. Que você _sabia_ e _escolheu_ não me contar.

Vithyaranu, Conde do VBAL Revile(Veículo Blindado de Ataque Leve) andou de um lado para o outro, sua capa esvoaçando. John continuou.

“Escuta, você gostando ou não, eu gostando ou não, estou no comando dessa missão. Ou você me conta o que está acontecendo, ou não me deixa outra opção. Eu tenho que concluir que você é um perigo para a equipe e dispensá-lo.”

Revile parou e se voltou para o resto do grupo, se recuperando de seus ferimentos. O peito de porcelana branco do memonek arfava enquanto tentava se acalmar. Sua pele de cerâmica parecia tão dura quanto aço, mas John sabia que era quebradiça, frágil.

Conde Revile respirou fundo. “Nós chamamos de _velloparatha_,” ele disse. “Em sua língua seria... Doente de mundo. Ou doença de mundo? É uma coisa que acontece... com o meu povo... quando vêm para o seu mundo. É uma doença de... de sentimentos. Emoção.”

“Você está enlouquecendo?” John perguntou, sua voz baixa. Ele queria dar ao Conde uma oportunidade de responder discretamente.

O memonek sorriu pesarosamente. “Às vezes sinto que sim. Eu passei uma hora de manhã observando um inseto que pousou no meu dedo. Um gafanhoto, segundo o anão. Pensei que nuca tinha visto algo tão perfeito e belo. Era admiração. Tão poderosa como jamais havia sentido. Em batalha hoje, raiva. Tão poderosa quanto."

“Pensei que poderia resistir. Quando cheguei aqui e não senti diferença, pensei que talvez a doença do mundo fosse uma lenda. Mas é um processo lento, essa doença. Essas emoções traiçoeiras.”

“Não há emoções de onde você vem?”

Conde Revile balançou a cabeça. “Não assim. Somos criaturas de razão, nós de Axiom. É nossa arte, nosso orgulho. Às vezes nossa religião, penso eu. Nós temos emoções; alegria, tristeza, espanto, luto. Mas elas são... uma moda. Elas não _acontecem_ conosco; são algo que desfrutamos, por conveniência. Aqui... tudo tem ordem e caos misturados. Até dentro de _mim_. Dentro de mim.” Revile colocou uma mão em seu peito.

“Em batalha, hoje. Aquela raiva não foi direcionada aos cães de guerra de Ajax. Foi a mim mesmo.”

“A você mesmo? Por quê? O que você...?”

“John,” o memonek disse, e agora era sua vez de sussurrar. "Eu estava com medo. Medo de... ser ferido, de falhar com você, falhar com meus amigos. De morrer. E desse medo surgiu uma... enorme raiva. Comigo mesmo. Raiva de que eu era tão fraco, tão... inútil. Raiva tão... forte, tão poderosa que... Esqueci quem era.”

John riu. “Isso é...” Ele sorriu amplamente. "Isso é normal. Todos nos sentimos assim."

“O quê? Não, você não entendeu...”

“Ah, eu não entendi, tá bom, deixa eu adivinhar. Você sentiu que ia se _mijar_ todo.”

“Sim!!”

“É, acontece com todo mundo.”

“Até você?!”

Sir John deu de ombros. “Tá brincando? Claro. Mas não ajuda. Você ainda tem um trabalho a fazer. Na verdade, eu diria que esse _é_ o trabalho. Qualquer um pode aprender a usar uma arma.” Ele colocou a mão no punho da sua espada. "Nada de especial nisso. É aprender a lidar com o _medo_. Esse é o trabalho. O que separa os amadores dos profissionais."

Conde Revile não disse nada, refletiu.

“Se sente melhor?”

Revile assentiu. “Eu sempre me recupero depois. Mas esses rompantes são inesperados. Como trovoadas em um céu limpo.”

“Hm. É. Pelo menos isso explica o que aconteceu quando conheceu Chamas.”

Conde Revile não gostou de ser lembrado daquilo. Ele olhou para o céu e balançou a cabeça. “Fiz papel de idiota.”

“Não seja tão duro consigo mesmo. Se estava tentando seduzir nossa maga do vazio, começou bem. Ela tem trezentos anos. Eu conheço ela desde que eu tinha 15 anos. Acho que jamais tinha visto ela ficar _envergonhada_. Enfim, agora que sei o que está acontecendo, sei que você é um adolescente crescido com glândulas hiperativas, posso ficar mais tranquilo.”

Chamas se aproximou e entregou a John um pequeno objeto pesado. Ela olhou para os dois e depois afastou-se.

“Ela estava certa,” John disse, olhando para o núcleo estelar de iridoss. “Eles não sabiam o que era, mas com certeza não queriam que a gente tivesse isso."

“Aqui,” John disse, entregando o motor ao Conde Revile. “Eu acho que já pode partir.”

Revile olhou para a elaborada gaiola de bronze e vidro contendo um campo estelar azulado rodopiando. “Parece que sim,” ele disse. Ele olhou para Sir John. “Não esperava que nossa amizade seria tão curta.”

John sorriu e talvez corou um pouco. “Bem,” ele disse olhando para o resto do grupo, “hoje em dia, ser amigo meu é uma profissão perigosa.”

O conde ficou mais sério. “Eu tive sorte de conhecer alguém como você nesse mundo.”

John deu de ombros. “Único mundo que eu conheço.”

Conde Revile ergueu o núcleo estelar. “Eu tenho deveres a cumprir. Vou retornar para casa e esse lugar será apenas uma memória." O conde estava claramente triste. “E você pode esquecer do alienígena que resgatou e sua nave de vidro e aço.”

“Ah, eu duvido,” John disse. “Mas te digo uma coisa. Nunca mais vou olhar para as estrelas do mesmo jeito.”

John ofereceu a mão. Revile a apertou e segurou.

“Se há muitos como você nesse mundo de deuses e feitiçaria,” o nobre capitão estelar memonek disse, “então sua vitória sobre o mal é garantida.”

“Não sei se há muitos,” John disse, soltando a mão. Ele olhou para o anão, a elfa, e o hakaan.

“Mas pode haver o suficiente.”

## Orcs

Uma raiva que não pode ser escondida. Uma fúria que os motiva em batalha. Orcs são famosos pelo mundo como exímios guerreiros—uma reputação que os pacíficos orcs acham desagradável.

O quinto dos povos falantes, orcs chegaram em Orden após os humanos e elfos. Eles fizeram suas casas nas terras fronteiriças entre essas duas culturas, preferindo as florestas naturais e evitando as silvas encantadas dos elfos. Por muitas gerações isso os colocou no caminho dos humanos que cortam as árvores e constroem estradas e fazendas.

Cada orc tem dentro de si um fogo que causa com que suas veias brilhem quando sangram. Essa raiva os impulsiona até o limite da morte. A dicotomia entre o desejo de ser deixado em paz e seu fervor em batalha é resumida por um provérbio anão:

“Seja grato que orcs não são rancorosos.”

### Sobre Orcs

A orc puxou seu machado do crânio partido do recém-falecido ogro. Heróis caídos se levantavam. Dazar curava os feridos.

A orc saltou do corpo que havia derrotado. “Elg era um ogro de ruína," ela disse. “Infectado com uma doença de troll. Uma inconveniência para trolls, mas para um ogro...” Ela indicou o ogro mutante. “Você não tinha como saber.”

“Ah, bom,” Sir John disse com claro alívio. “Você fala Caeliano.”
“Sim.” A orc disse. Ela parecia distante. Ela olhou para John. “Eu falo o idioma dos seus conquistadores.”

John sorriu. Ele já gostava dessa orc.

“Pelas estrelas!” Ardashir disse com alegria estampada em seu rosto. “Você salvou nossas vidas. Deve ser você que buscamos.”

Khorva olhou para os heróis reunidos. Um grupo diverso. "Vocês fizeram a maior parte do trabalho," ela disse. Ela parecia desinteressada neles e em geral.

“Você esperou que provássemos nosso valor antes de agir! Dazar disse, e julgando pela forma que falou não era claro se estava fazendo uma acusação ou apenas uma observação.

“Se não conseguissem se defender,” a orc disse, “não faria diferença ajudar vocês.” Seus olhos pousaram em Sir John.

“John,” ele disse.

“Khorva,” a orc disse.

“Dos Uivantes,” John disse.

“_Fui_ dos Uivantes,” Khorva disse, e olhou para a floresta, como evidente desinteresse. _Já em desvantagem_, John pensou. _Bom, se fosse fácil, não seria chamado de trabalho_.

“Nós estávamos a sua procura,” Dazar disse.

Khorva acenou sem olhar para o anão.

“Eu imaginei,” ela disse. “Parecia que o plano era vagar pela floresta até alguma coisa tentar matar vocês na esperança de atrair minha atenção.”

“Bem, a gente não tinha muitas outras opções.” John disse. “Nós buscamos comandantes dos Uivantes.”

“Esse seria o meu irmão.”

John olhou para Chamas. “Nos disseram que os Uivantes eram comandados por uma mulher.”

Khorva suspirou e olhou para longe, na direção da floresta. “Minha irmã morreu deixando meu povo sem líder. Eu tentei salvar ela. Falhei. Eu tentei liderar no lugar dela. Falhei." Ela disse essas coisas sem emoção, sem entonação. Então seu olhar caiu para o chão de areia e seus olhos desfocaram. Um momento passou.

“Como os mortos são ardilosos," ela disse, sua voz vazia, “para nos atormentar do túmulo.”

John viu as espadas quebradas na sua cinta. “Cinco Espadas,” ele disse. “Cinco espadas quebradas.” Ele viu Khorva de nova forma. “Eu acho que nunca vi um orc sobrevivente de três desafios.”

“Eles não conseguiram me matar e eu não cedi.” Ela olhou para o grupo ceticamente. “Quatro de vocês?”

“Nós estamos apenas começando,” John disse defensivamente. “E estou trabalhando em um amigo meu. Vamos ver. Um dos Cavaleiros da Tempestade.”

Khorva franziu a testa. “Eu pensei que a Falange Dracônica tinha morrido.”

“Pois é,” John disse, desejando que Vaant estivesse ali para ver isso. “Eles não conseguiram matá-lo," ele deu um sorriso selvagem. “E ele não cedeu.”

Khorva assentiu uma vez, impressionada.

“Precisamos dos Uivantes,” John disse. “Se recuperarmos a sua tribo...?” Khorva suspirou e não disse nada por vários momentos. Depois de um tempo, ela voltou de seu devaneio e olhou para John.

“Prefiro ir pescar.”

John sorriu. “Minha irmã gostava de pescar também.”

“Por que não falar com meu irmão?”

“Por que não somos estúpidos,” Chamas disse, e Khorva fixou o olhar nela, se endireitando. Os olhos castanhos da orc queimaram e pareceu que o grupo cresceu em sua estima. Ela assentiu uma vez. “O povo das fazendas e campos vai à guerra,” Dazar disse, usando o termo orc para humanos. “Uma guerra contra Lorde Saxton e seu sacerdote.”

Khorva se voltou para John. “Por que isso é problema seu?”

John tentou encontrar uma forma de contar a história que não demorasse o dia todo. Ele chutou uma pedra enquanto pensava.

“Uma família veio até mim. Eles estão desesperados. Seu vilarejo está desesperado. Eles podem morrer ou lutar. E não conseguem lutar. Então me contrataram.”

Khorva ergueu uma sobrancelha. “Por quanto te compraram?” “Nove peças de cobre.”

Khorva o encarou. “Isso não é nada”

John deu de ombros. “Era tudo o que tinham. O vilarejo vendeu tudo que restava.”

John relaxou quando viu os olhos de Khorva suavizarem. Ela entendia.

“Uma oferta difícil de recusar,” ela disse.

“Sim.” Dazar assentiu solenemente.

Khorva olhou para cima para observar três corvos circulando ociosamente, subindo, acompanhando o mormaço aos céus. “Em quantos estão os oponentes?”

“Saxton não tem regulares. Apenas alguns cavaleiros, podemos dar cabo deles. Mas ele tem a Águabranca. Liderada pela Quebra-ossos Dorokor. São três companhias de infantaria leve orc contra um punhado de recrutas camponeses. Precisamos dos Uivantes.”

“Talvez,” Khorva disse, e se virou dos corvos para olhar para os heróis. “Eu conheço Dorokor, ela não é como meu irmão. Uma cabeça de carne e músculos. Dorokor é uma pensadora. Você busca os Uivantes por que busca uma oposição à Águabranca." Ela olhou para John. "Mas ainda melhor, _converse_ com Dorokor. Negue a Saxton seu clã orc de estimação, e _conquiste_ a lealdade da Águabranca."

“Isso é possível?” Chamas perguntou.

Um momento passou. Khorva não interrompeu contato visual com John. “É possível," ela disse.

“Os Uivantes _ou_ a tribo da Águabranca,” Dazar disse. “Qualquer uma seria um inimigo formidável em qualquer batalha, tal é a reputação de guerra dos orcs."

Khorva balançou a cabeça. “Orcs não tem apreço pela batalha. Nós apreciamos as árvores e o verde. Nós amamos terras intocadas. Por esse motivo Kul nos colocou no mundo. O último dos povos falantes originais.”

“Porém Kul também colocou o fogo dentro de vocês,” Chamas disse.

“Sim,” Dazar acrescentou. “Vocês não são pacifistas, são guerreiros!”

“Nós somos pacifistas,” Khorva disse com ênfase que quase pareceu um grito. Então fez uma pausa e um sorriso passou por seus lábios. “E somos guerreiros.”

“Não estamos aqui para fechar um negócio,” John disse. “Não estamos à venda e você também não. Isso é sobre corrigir um erro. É sobre ajudar pessoas.” Ele pausou e algo não ensaiado espontaneamente deixou seus lábios.

“É sobre viver consigo mesmo. Dormir à noite.”

“Batalhas não trazem sono tranquilo,” Khorva disse. “O oposto, eu acho.”

“Batalhas trazem glória! Batalhas criam heróis!” Dazar insistiu, e John sentiu que aprendera algo sobre o anão naquele momento. Ele conseguia perceber que Dazar acreditava que isso era verdade, e sabia que era mentira. Era um teste.

“Guerra só cria uma coisa. Cadáveres.” Khorva olhou para baixo, na direção do alto theocron, que assentiu. Teste superado.

“E veteranos,” Sir John disse. “Que cobiçam paz.” Khorva concordou. Respeito. “Sim,” ela disse. Ela olhou para cada herói e então para John novamente.

“Bem,” ela disse. “O que fazemos agora?”

### Traços de Orc

## Polder

Atrás dos humanos, polders são a mais numerosa e diversa linhagem em Orden. Eles não são humanos, mas vivem entre eles e compartilham seus deuses e cultura. Quase todas as culturas humanas em Orden tem um santo polder ou um santo humano venerado por polders.

Baixinhos, 3,5 pés (1m) em média, as origens dos polder são obscuras. Eles são uma espécie jovem que, como os humanos, não tem deus padroeiro. Sua habilidade Forma Sombria faz com que desfrutem de reputação como excelentes espiões e ladrões. Muitos polder consideram isso uma calúnia infundada e apontam para sua outra reputação como famosos chefes de cozinha, ainda que polders possam ser encontrados em qualquer profissão, especialmente em cidades.

### Sobre Polders

Os três camponeses—Jago, sua esposa Sarah, e Beth, irmã dele—estavam sentados juntos assistindo os três heróis conversarem na movimentada sala comunal da estalagem. De fato, Jackson Bootblack parecia estar monopolizando a conversa.

“Esse tipo de coisa não funciona se for só um grupo de caça-ratos como o nosso,", o polder disse. “As pessoas precisam se rebelar. Faz quinze anos que Omund morreu—quinze anos lutando contra lobos, bandidos e coisa pior. O povo dá boas-vindas a um tirano depois disso. Eles gostam de ordem, sabe? Eles se adaptam."

“Se você pisa na grama por tempo suficiente, ela aprende a ficar deitada.” Uma Névoa se Enrola em Torno de Chamas Moribundas disse. “Mas o que _você_ acha?”

“Hein?” o polder perguntou a ela. Porém, olhou para Sir John que o observava.
“Você diz que o povo não tem estômago para uma rebelião,” Chamas disse. “Mas e você?”

“Ah,” o polder disse, “Eu digo que o que digo não importa muito. Por que ele tá olhando pra mim desse jeito?” ele perguntou à alta elfa e apontou pra Sir John. Percebendo que estava sendo rude, John sacudiu a cabeça para a desanuviar. “Desculpa, é que... Eu nunca tinha conhecido um polder antes,” ele disse.

“Você tá me zoando?” Jackson disse.

“Não! Desculpa, é que...”

“Você é de onde, da lua? Onde você nasceu que nunca conheceu um polder antes? Tem polders por todos os povoados e vilarejos daqui até o mar.”

“Sério? Que estranho. Eu sou de Tor, estive por toda parte—só que nunca conheci um polder antes.”

Jackson olhou para sua amiga, a alta elfa maga do vazio. “Estou doido?”
“Você não está doido.” Chamas sorriu. Ela estava gostando de ver dois de seus amigos se conhecerem. “Parece que John apenas nunca encontrou com um.”

“Bem, somos adoráveis,” o polder disse, e bebeu um gole de cerveja. “Eles deviam estar por perto, pelo jeito,” John disse. “Só que provavelmente não percebi.”

O polder colocou o copo na mesa. “Ah, obrigado. Muitíssimo obrigado. Sabe o que é engraçado? Eu nunca tive qualquer problema pra perceber grandalhões como você. Um de vocês faz tanto barulho quanto uma vaca, o que... Nem sei como conseguem esse feito."

“Você está dizendo, mas... minha sua voz é tão alta quanto a minha!”

“Me refiro ao jeito que andam por aí. A forma que se movem, se levantam e se sentam. Vocês fazem uma barulheira.”

Jago, Sarah e Beth sorriam com essa discussão.

“Humanos são ruidosos, sim,” Chamas concordou.

“Temos mesmo que... podemos falar de outro assunto, por favor?” John perguntou.

“É que...” o polder não desistia. “Sério que você nunca... nunca entrou em uma estalagem? Pela dentadura de Cavall, perdi a conta de quantas estalagens e tavernas onde estive que tinham donos polder, polders na cozinha ou servindo mesas. Uma das duas coisas que fazemos bem, eu acho.”

“É?” John perguntou. “Qual a outra?”

O pequeno homem sorriu. “Entrar em lugares onde não devíamos estar.”
“Aí sim,” Sir John disse. “Você dizia que precisamos do apoio das pessoas. Eu concordo.”

“Sim, tudo bem. Vamos ao que interessa: Como mobilizar as pessoas.” O polder levou a pergunta a sério. “Não é difícil. Primeiro, precisamos de _alguém_ para eles se mobilizarem em torno. Eu poderia inventar alguém, bolar um herói local popular, mas e se pudermos encontrar um de verdade? Ele só precisa parecer heroico, só isso. Eu cuido do resto.”

“Estou trabalhando nisso,” John disse. “Mas... Está indo mais devagar do que eu pensava. Estou apostando numa chance remota.

“Qual o problema?”

John pensou em como expressar o que sabia em palavras. "Você sabe..." ele deu de ombros "Algumas pessoas só podem ser heroicas se pensam que são melhores que todo mundo. Outras pessoas só podem ser heroicas depois de perceber que não são. E algumas pessoas...”

Sir John olhou para sua bebida, para o copo caro e limpo que o estalajadeiro lhe deu por tê-lo reconhecido. Ele virou o copo lentamente na mesa, e agora falava principalmente consigo mesmo. “Algumas pessoas ainda precisam descobrir o porquê.”

“Qual é melhor?” Jackson perguntou, e Chamas percebeu que o pequeno homem estava testando John.

John respirou fundo e voltou à realidade. “Bom. Se eu tivesse escolha, não precisaríamos de um herói,” ele disse.

O polder olhou para a alta elfa e acenou, impressionado. Passou no teste.
“Certo. Bem, se já tem um candidato, eu já posso começar. A outra parte é: Precisamos de uma boa história—curta, impactante. Algo que vai pegar, fácil de simpatizar, mas extravagante. Um imposto. Um pedágio! Pedágio de ponte, um clássico. Um ogro... não, três ogros. Sim, três é melhor. Três ogros em uniformes de Ajax. Uma figura solitária os enfrenta. Viu só? Fácil.”

“Onde vamos encontrar três ogros?” John perguntou.

“Como assim?” Agora era a vez do polder ficar confuso.

“Como assim, 'Como assim'? John disse.

“Eu não... não precisamos de ogros _de verdade_.” Jackson olhou para a elfa. “Ele é assim mesmo?”

“Confie em mim,” a maga do vazio disse.

“Você quer dizer que vai inventar tudo?!” John exclamou.

“Eu...” Jackson olhou com incredulidade para a alta elfa maga do vazio, e então de volta para o humano. “Sim, é isso que quero dizer. Ele sabe o que eu faço?” ele perguntou à elfa.

“Ele vai aprender.” Chamas sorriu.

O polder olhou para Sir John novamente. “Olá. Eu ganho a vida mentindo. E sou _muito bom_ nisso. De vez em quando também mato pessoas, mas só se mentir e fugir não funcionam.”

John olhou para Chamas. “Eu pensei que ele era ladrão.”

“Eu era ladrão,” o polder disse.

“Você _foi_ ladrão.”

“É, eu trabalhei com O Relógio. Provavelmente ainda trabalho—eles não te deixam simplesmente ir embora. Nós temos um acordo. Eu concordo em fazer o que me dizem e eles concordam em não me dizer o que fazer.”

“Eles te expulsaram, ou você so deixou?”

“Depende de para quem você pergunta. Eu não gosto que mandem em mim. É uma coisa de polder. Hereditário ou ancestral, sei lá. Todo mundo quer um chef polder até começarem a nos dizer o que cozinhar.”

“Então o que você é agora?”

“Eu sou irritante.”

A elfa sorriu. “Ele é um Trovador—um dos melhores.”

Sir John olhou pra ele, acenando. “Nenhum alaúde, eu vejo. E não parece o tipo que se senta perto da lareira para contar histórias.”

O polder sorria. “Não sou esse tipo de Trovador. Sou do outro tipo. Eu penso que a melhor história é a que as pessoas contam umas às outras.”

“Propaganda,” Sir John disse, um sorriso se espalhando pelo seu rosto. O polder apontou um dedo pra ele e sorriu. John ouviu a porta da estalagem abrir atrás de si. Isso não era novidade, mas o suspiro dos clientes foi.

“Ei,” o polder disse, olhando além de John para a entrada. “Ei, acho que seu herói popular apareceu. Nossa, ele parece mesmo heroico. Ou ela, nunca sei com esses caras.

John se virou para olhar.

Sir Vaantikalisax surgia pela entrada, suas escamas e armadura reluzindo pelo fogo da lareira. Sir John pulou da cadeira, um enorme sorriso no rosto.

“Eu, eh...” Vaantikalisax disse. O alto e largo draconato olhava de John para os três camponeses. Jago, Sarah e Beth estavam mais radiantes de alegrai que John, se é que isso era possível.

O cavaleiro dragão os encarou por um momento, então se voltou ao seu amigo.

“Talvez você esteja certo,” ele disse.

### Traços Polder

Heróis polder tem acesso aos seguintes traços:

#### Traço Clássico: Forma Sombria

Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Forma Sombria**
_Você se torna uma sombra._

| **Magia**         |       **Manobra** |
| ----------------- | ----------------: |
| **📏 Personagem** | **🎯 Personagem** |

**Efeito:** Você se achata como uma sombra encostada em uma parede ou chão que esteja tocando, e se torna escondido de qualquer criatura da qual tenha cobertura ou encobrimento, ou que não esteja observando você. Enquanto estiver em forma de sombra, você tem total consciência do seu entorno, golpes feitos contra você e testes para procurar por você recebem desvantagem. Você não pode se mover ou ser movido forçadamente, e você não pode realizar ações principais ou manobras exceto para sair dessa forma ou dirigir criaturas sob o seu controle, como as que invoca usando uma habilidade. Qualquer habilidade ou efeito que tenha como alvo mais de 1 quadrado afeta você nessa forma apenas se afetar explicitamente a superfície na qual está encostado. Você pode sair dessa forma como uma manobra. Se a superfície na qual está encostado é destruída, essa habilidade termina e você sofre 1d6 de dano que não pode ser reduzido de nenhuma forma.

## Ressurgidos

Os mortos andam entre nós. Nem todos eles estão satisfeitos com isso.

Ao contrário dos rituais de necromancia que produzem aparições e zumbis, ressurgidos se levantam da tumba por uma combinação de morte injusta e ardente desejo de vingança. Criaturas alimentadas por pura vontade, eles não precisam de comida, água ou ar—e a contrário dos seus primos zumbificados, mantém todas as memórias e personalidade que tinham em vida.

Ressurgidos são raros. Muitos são caçados por camponeses ignorantes que vêem apenas seu corpo morto e imaginam o pior. Os que sobrevivem aos ancinhos das multidões optam por uma vida solitária, geralmente como almas errantes buscando a companhia dos vivos ainda que constantemente a tema, ou migram para uma metrópole como Leitopreto ou Capital, onde os perdidos se reúnem para ter um novo lar.

### Sobre Ressurgidos

“Tô te dizendo, a gente tá sendo _seguido_.”

“Ninguém sabe que a gente tá aqui. Ninguém nem sabe que esse lugar existe! A gente tem o dia todo. Escondemos tudo aqui, e levamos uma amostra para...” O ladrão em comando puxou um frasco de um caixote repleto de palha e o inspecionou.

“É que...” o ladrão mais jovem falou, nervosamente. "Tinha uma lady cavaleira em Leitopreto xeretando. Parecia coisa séria. Eu tive... arrepios quando olhei pra ela.

“Ei,” o ladrão em comando disse, sua sobrancelha franzindo enquanto olhava para o rótulo do frasco. “Onde tu disse que comprou isso aqui? Falou um navio—um navio de onde?”

“Não sei, uh... uh, Capital eu acho.”

O ladrão comandante olhou para o jovem apavorado. “Essa lady cavaleira—ela tinha um brasão vermelho e azul no escudo dela?”

“Não pode ser a Lady Filliamo, né?” um dos outros ladrões disse. Ouviu-se uma batida firme na porta do esconderijo. Uma porta que, do lado de fora, parecia com uma parte normal da parede.

“Ah, cê tá de brincadeira.”

“Nãonãonão! Como pode... Capital foi _nove meses atrás!_”

“Ela é ressurgida, idiota! Ela nem precisa respirar. Ela pode ter vindo andando até aqui! Na água, pelo fundo do mar! Por que não falou nada?

“Eu falei! Desgraçado, eu acabei de falar! To tentando te dizer faz—”

“Cara, tem uma diferença entre, 'Ei, eu acho que estão nos seguindo' e 'Tem uma policial sem-morte vindo nos pegar!’”

Um dos quatro ladrões abriu um frasco e molhou seu punhal no óleo avermelhado ali contido.

“O que isso vai fazer? Ela já tá morta! ” Outra batida na porta escondida.“Esquece. Deixa ela bater. Peguem o máximo que puderem, vamos fugir pelos fundos.”

O ladrão comandante correu para a porta de trás do esconderijo. Ele a abriu—e os outros ladrões viram um brilho prateado queimar silenciosamente pela sua testa. Através da porta aberta, eles podiam ver a silhueta da cavaleira, sua mão aberta levantada à sua frente.

Ela fechou a mão como um punho e o _julgamento_ que havia colocado no comandante detonou, o jogando pra trás. Ele se esparramou no chão, consciente mas atordoado.

A cavaleira de pele cinzenta entrou no esconderijo. Saltos metálicos ecoaram pelo piso de madeira. Ela parecia descontraída, mas seus olhos queimavam por dentro.

“Rapazes,” Lady Filliamo disse em tom agradável. “Manhã agitada.”

“Como você... isso é impossível, como nos _encontrou_?” Ela olhou para o homem que gemia no chão. “Seu chefe não lhe contou sobre a marca de vingança?”

“Você marcou a gente. Lá em Capital. Você marcou um de nós e... andou até aqui.”

“Não seja tolo. Marquei você em Leitopreto. Capital foi só trabalho de detetive comum. Eu vim de navio.” Ela sorriu—lábios pretos em pele cinza pálida.

“Vamos lá.” O mais valente dos três ladrões que sobraram sacou adagas gêmeas. “Ela não consegue pegar todos nós—”

Lady Filliamo fez um gesto largo com sua mão direita e marcas de prata queimaram pelas testas dos três ladrões. Ouviu-se um estrondo de armas caindo no chão. Três pares de mãos lentamente subiram pro ar. “Bons rapazes. Aqui, podem colocar.” Ela jogou três pares de algemas no chão.

“Pera aí, você não pode nos prender,” disse um dos ladrões, desarmado e ainda com as mãos pro alto, “Aqui não é Capital. Você não tem jurisdição!”

Lady Filliamo deu de ombros. “Sou cavaleira da igreja. Jurisdição é para a guarda da cidade.” Ela sacou poucos centímetros de sua espada prateada de dentro da bainha, só para mostrar a lâmina para eles.

“ _Eu lido em aço._ ”

### Traços de Ressurgido

Heróis ressurgidos tem acesso aos seguintes traços:

#### Traço Clássico: Vida Anterior

Escolha uma linhagem a qual pertencia antes de morrer. Seu tamanho é igual ao dessa linhagem e sua velocidade é 5. A não ser que selecione um dos traços comprados de vida passada (veja abaixo), você não recebe qualquer outro traço de linhagem da sua linhagem original.

#### Traço Clássico: Resistente mas Desbotado

Seu corpo de morto-vivo concede imunidade a dano de frio, de corrupção, elétrico e de veneno igual ao seu Nível, mas você tem fraqueza a dano de fogo 5. Você não pode sufocar, e não precisa comer ou beber para se manter vivo.

Além disso, quando seu Vigor alcança o valor negativo do seu valor Ofegante, você fica inerte em vez de morrer. Você é derrubado e não pode se levantar. Você continua a observar seu entorno, mas não pode falar, realizar ações principais, manobras, ações de movimento ou reações. Enquanto inerte dessa forma, se você sofre qualquer dano de fogo, seu corpo é destruído e você morre. Caso contrário, após 12 horas, você recupera Vigor igual ao seu valor de recuperação.

#### Traços Comprados de Ressurgido

Você tem 2 pontos de linhagem para gastar nos seguintes traços, ou 3 pontos de linhagem se seu tamanho for 1P: (Construção Rápida: Sem Sangue, mais Influência se seu tamanho for 1P.)

**Marca de Vingança (2 Pontos)**
Com uma manobra, você coloca um selo mágico em uma criatura dentro de 10 quadrados de distância . Quando você coloca um selo, você decide onde ele aparece no corpo da criatura, e se o selo é visível apenas para você ou para todas as criaturas. Você sempre sabe a direção para a localização exata de uma criatura que você selou que esteja no mesmo mundo. Você pode ter um número de selos ativos igual ao seu Nível, e pode remover um selo de uma criatura quando quiser (nenhuma ação necessária). Se você já colocou o número máximo de selos ativos e coloca um novo selo, seu selo mais antigo desaparece sem nenhum outro efeito.

Além disso, você tem a seguinte habilidade clássica: (Habilidades clássicas podem ser usadas à vontade)

## Invasores do Futuro

A espécie serviçal original dos synliroi—psions malignos com poder quase divino—os kuran’zoi se libertaram durante a Primeira Guerra Psíquica. Nos séculos desde então, eles construíram sua própria cultura e civilização como nômades da timescape. O exônimo “invasores do futuro” foi dado a eles pelos habitantes dos planos inferiores que, vendo a tecnologia avançada que os kuran’zoi possuem, concluíram que eles devem ser do futuro.

Extraordinariamente raros em Orden, invasores do futuro prosperam no Mar de Estrelas, o Mar Entre Mundos, onde os ventos do limbo rugem.

Em vez de olhos, kuran’zoi possuem sensores oculares cristalinos que concedem visão espectral de alta resolução e são fortalecidos pelas extremas radiações encontradas no Mar de Estrelas, permitindo que eles operem livremente fora de suas naves apenas com seus respiradores portáteis. Invasores do futuro também tem dois pares de braços, permitindo que usam armas corpo-a-corpo e à distância simultaneamente. Um kuran’zoi bem treinado sozinho é um esquadrão de um homem só.

### Sobre Invasores do Futuro

“Você vai me dar a localização da nave em que chegou aqui.”

Taxiarca Lycaon andava de um lado para o outro fora da arruinada igreja de pedra. A mulher de quatro braços, olhos de cristal e uma faixa de cabelo rosa flamejante no centro de sua cabeça raspada zombou dele. Ela estava acorrentada aos restos de uma coluna de pedra fora da igreja.

“Seu cérebro é tão pequeno que precisa falar para conseguir pensar?” O sorriso da mulher era de desdém.

Lycaon avançou em direção à alienígena, agarrou a corrente em volta de sua cintura e puxou, esticando-a para que a corrente em volta do pescoço da mulher se apertasse. “Você vai morrer de qualquer jeito," ele disse. “Se deseja me negar o prazer de ouvir seus uivos e gritos por piedade, me diga o que quero saber agora e meus cães vão te matar rapidamente.”

De perto, ela poderia ver as costuras finas na bochechas e testa de Lycaon, as suaves diferenças de tom de pele que mostravam que sua pele não lhe pertencia.

“Você parece ser feito de pedacinhos,” a alienígena disse enquanto examinava Lycaon, seus olhos cristalinos capturando e refletindo luz prismática. “E não os melhores pedaços. Restos? É isso que você é? Is that what you are? Um conjunto de retalhos descartados ambulante? Hahah, E eu pensava que os proteanos eram medonhos. Alguém precisa avisá-los! Tem criaturas mais asquerosas e inúteis na timescape.”

O Taxiarca sorriu para si mesmo, assentiu respeitosamente aos epítetos da mulher. Descansou um pé nos destroços caídos, antes parte da parede de pedra da igreja, e apoiou seu braço no joelho. Ele não se vestia como os outros cães de guerra. Nada de couro preto pra ele. Estava trajado com um peitoral dourado modelado com um relevo de cabeça de carneiro, uma capa branca às costas. Grevas douradas, botas e luvas de couro vermelhas. Os demais cães de guerra tinham apenas madeixas de cabelo, mas o seu era longo e loiro.

Ele casualmente fez pose de janota. “Onde está sua nave-mundo?” disse em um tom mais razoável. “Ou chegou aqui em um talhaestrelas monoposto?” Em resposta, a alienígena arregalou os olhos, revelando surpresa.“Percebe?” o Taxiarca disse, impressionado consigo mesmo. “Não sou primitivo como esses camponeses, que te perseguiram por ser extra-terrestre." Ele acenou para as pessoas do vilarejo que observavam dos estábulos há alguma distância. "Eu sou da Elite de Ajax. Melhor que seus escolhidos. Fui criado para a vitória." DE fato, Taxiarca Lycaon quase parecia completamente humano. Bonito e em forma como uma estátua de Phaedros, nas quais seu modelo quase certamente havia sido inspirado. A não ser que olhasse de perto, não havia sinais de que era um produto dos banco de corpos. “Se aceitar me guiar até sua nave, eu te liberto.”

A alienígena suspirou. “‘Blaap blaap blaap,’” ela disse. “Você devia ouvir a si mesmo. Soa como um thrazz latindo pra mim. Eu me pergunto, quem segura sua coleira? Com certeza um microcérebro como você não comandaria mais do que essa ralé.” Ela acenou com a cabeça para os outros vinte e poucos cães de guerra.

A provocação funcionou. Lycaon deu a volta com um murro na mandíbula da alienígena. A cabeça dela bateu na coluna. Isso a atordoou, mas ela se recuperou e riu.

“Vejam a facilidade com que é instigado!” ela disse. Ela cuspiu sangue azul escuro e se virou para os camponeses reunidos. “Vocês aí! Por que tem medo desses... retalhos? Retalhos de gente remendados? Até o pior de vocês vale mais que eles.”

“Talvez do ar,” Capitã de Vôo Lyria ofereceu, enquanto acariciava as penas do seu falcão migante de montaria para acalmá-lo. “Eu poderia fazer o reconhecimento da floresta em volta do...”

“Não!” Taxiarca Lycaon apontou o dedo para a Senhora de Falcão e andou em sua direção. " Você é da Elite de caça alada de Ajax, e eu fui escolhido comandante de brigada. Nós não somos sucateiros! Essa aqui..." ele espetou um dedo enluvado na direção da alienígena, "... vai obedecer, ou vou dá-la para meus cães de guerra.” Ele se virou para encarar a alienígena acorrentada, que bocejou. Lycaon fervilhava.

“Eles podem te despedaçar,” ele disse a ela, e seu esquadrão de soldados, todos em couro preto e ombreiras douradas, começaram a fazer sons de latidos, caindo na risada em seguida.

“Ou eu posso deixar meu crucibita derreter a carne dos seus ossos.” Em resposta, um cão de guerra trajado de couro da cabeças aos pés, usando uma máscara pesada com círculos de vidro onde os olhos deveriam estar e um tipo de cilindro sobre sua boca, se adiantou. O longo e fino tubo de cobre em sua mão se conectava com um grande tanque de metal à suas costas.

“Devo te deixar escolher?” o Taxiarca disse, e sacou um punhal de sua cinta. "Vou cortar um dedo fora. Se gritar, eu te mato. Se não gritar, outro dedo. Se gritar dessa vez...”

Aos poucos todos começaram a ouvir os sons de uma conversa, silenciosa, em tom metálico. As vozes soaram cada vez mais alto até que finalmente todos pudessem ouvir.

“... devemos estar preparados para qualquer coisa,” uma voz grave falou, imponente, e imagens começaram a se formar em meio e em torno dos cães de guerra, da Senhora de Falcões e do Taxiarca. Pareciam gravuras desbotadas de um manuscrito, ganhando clareza e pigmentação, e finalmente profundidade, enquanto suas vozes soavam mais límpidas e audíveis.

“Ah, obrigado pelos brilhantes conselhos táticos,” outra voz, mais estridente, pronunciou.

Subitamente, as imagens se tornaram tridimensionais, sólidas, e sete heróis estavam entre eles. Um humano em armadura de placas desgastada. Um anão e seu cajado com ponta de ampulheta. Uma orc com um machado de batalha enorme descansado casualmente em seu ombro. Um polder com rapieiras gêmeas nas mãos. Uma alta elfa esbelta e altiva com pele negra como a noite e cabelos dourados. Um hakaan desarmado mais alto que todos. E um cavaleiro dragão. Dentre esse grupo diversificado foi o cavaleiro dragão que arrancou um suspiro dos camponeses. Mesmo à distância e com os cães de guerra entre eles, puderam reconhecer o brasão do Bom Rei Omund no escudo do cavaleiro.

Os cães de guerra se assustaram. Por um momento, parecia que iriam fugir com essa intrusão repentina, mas o Taxiarca bradou “Em posição!” e eles não cederam terreno, a incerteza da ameaça de um grupo de heróis derrotada em suas mentes pela certeza de temerem o seu comandante.

O hakaan olhou em volta e viu o grupo de aldeões observando à distância, reunidos em volta do que pareciam ser estábulos. Ele acenou. “Olá!” disse, sorrindo.

Um dos aldeões acenou de volta antes de ser calado.

John olhou para o Taxiarca e imediatamente compreendeu a situação. A imagem era clara o suficiente.

Havia algo sobre os cães de guerra. Eles amavam a crueldade de Ajax—se deleitavam com ela. John havia cruzado espadas com outros comandantes do exército de Ajax no passado. O Comandante de Infantaria Vordokov era um profissional—podia ser convencido, mas ele era orc.

Não os cães de guerra—eles eram fanáticos.

“O que é isso?” o Taxiarca clamou com um sorriso ávido. “Aliados da alienígena?” Ele projetava confiança. Tentava encorajar seus desconfiados soldados.

“Aliados de todos que sofrem, e buscam justiça,” o anão anunciou. Sir John ignorou o cão de guerra, inclinou a cabeça na direção da alienígena. “Chamas?”

“Uma kuran’zoi,” a alta elfa disse, e a alienígena ergueu a cabeça com orgulho. “Uma invasora do futuro dos planos superiores. Qual seja a verdade, não posso dizer, e nenhum povo é uniforme. Mas por reputação? Eles são intratáveis, ingovernáveis, detestam autoridade, odeiam a tirania, e são total e completamente destemidos.”

John observava a alienígena. Ela ria em aprovação do resumo de Chamas. Isso era suficiente para Sir John, eles poderiam tratar dos detalhes mais tarde. Após tudo o que passaram juntos no passado, ele confiava em Chamas explicitamente.

Ele podia antever como os próximos momentos se desdobrariam. Tudo o que precisava fazer era tomar a iniciativa. Se ele estava certo, a coisa toda seria resolvida em segundos. Não havia tempo para comunicarem-se. Nenhum tempo para planejar, e todos precisavam fazer sua parte.

John sabia o que viria a seguir, mas ele não era um assassino. Ele tinha seu próprio papel para interpretar. Deu um passo a frente, se distanciando de seus colegas, e percebeu que o Taxiarca não reagiu. Isso dizia muito. Ele olhava seu inimigo, olhos nos olhos.

“Ela será solta,” John comandou, com voz de aço, “ou você morre aqui.” Ele podia sentir os músculos de seu companheiros se contraindo, a companhia inteira como uma mola de aço comprimida ao máximo.

Lycaon ergueu a cabeça para Sir John e deu alguns passos imprudentes na direção do Tático. Ele estava quase ao alcance. Mas perto o suficiente.

“Vejo que é um homem, como Ajax. Por que se rebaixa com essas... criaturas?” O Taxiarca cão de guerra olhava para a elfa, o gigante, o polder, o anão e o cavaleiro dragão. “Pouco mais que coisas viscosas que rastejaram pra fora do oceano? Junte-se a nós. Junte-se a mim. Junte-se a Ajax. Vai ser melhor pra você..."—sua voz baixou, quase um suspiro—“... estar no lado vencedor para variar.”

Sir John respirou fundo, sua linguagem corporal mudou e isso foi suficiente. Várias coisas aconteceram ao mesmo tempo, tão rápido que ninguém mais tarde saberia dizer quem agiu primeiro.

Os olhos de Chamas brilharam como um céu estrelado. As correntes da invasora do futuro dissolveram em espaço estelar e reapareceram em volta da Capitã de Vôo Lyria, acorrentando seus braços. Ela estava dando à senhora de falcões uma desculpa para ficar de fora dessa. Deuses, John estava feliz de tê-la com eles.

A mão direita superior da invasora do futuro disparou, como se ela estivesse esperando que a maga do vazio fizesse exatamente o que havia acabado de fazer, e sua pistola de mésons saltou das mãos do cão de guerra que havia a acorrentado. A pistola de vidro e bronze veio direto para sua mão e sua ponta brilhou com luz prismática.

John sentiu sua pele endurecer quando Dazar o abençoou, e da sombra de Sol causada por Taxiarca Lycaon o polder Jackson Bootblack emergiu, uma rapieira em cada mão, e ninguém havia visto ele se mover de onde estava um momento atrás.

O hakaan entrou em ação e passou rapidamente por ele como um borrão.

No mesmo instante, um chamado—uma corneta. Vindo diretamente de trás de John, uma explosão de som como um acorde tocado por uma dúzia de trombetas, e a esperança cantou em seu coração—o chamado claro do último Cavaleiro de Tempestade!

Ao som, a orc arremeteu na direção de um grupo de soldados cães de guerra, seu machado já rodopiando.

John não havia hesitado, ele já havia sacado sua espada e alfange. "Tá bom, seu retalhado sem mãe." Ele investiu contra Lycaon que se atrapalhava com a espada em sua cinta.

<p style="text-align:center;">“Draw steel!”</p>

---

**Mente Imparável (2 Pontos)**
Sua mente permite que mantenha o foco em qualquer situação. Você não pode ser deixado atordoado.

# **Antecedentes**

O que faz um herói? Seu desejo de defender os inocentes e proteger os outros é inato, de alguma forma? Eles nascem sabendo que tiranos devem ser derrotados? Algum poder maior instila a ideia de que por vezes aqueles que menos merecem compaixão são os que mais precisam dela?

Não. As experiências de vida e antecedentes de um herói fazem dele quem é. Esses antecedentes começam com a cultura na qual o herói foi criado, e passam pela carreira que os levou à vida de aventuras.

## Cultura

A cultura de um herói descreve as crenças, costumes, valores e forma de vida da comunidade na qual foi criado. Essa comunidade proporciona experiências de vida que dão ao personagem algumas estatísticas de jogo. Mesmo que um herói não compartilhe os valores de sua cultura, aqueles valores moldaram seu desenvolvimento inicial e estilo de vida. Na verdade, algumas pessoas se tornam heróis principalmente por rejeitarem os hábitos da sua cultura.

Para nosso propósito, a cultura de um herói representa pessoas, não um lugar. Sim, você pode ter crescido na grande cidade de Capital, mas sua cultura é mais específica que isso. A cultura de um herói pode ser a Casa Alvaro, uma nobre casa em Capital onde ele foi criado. Outra cultura pode ser de um grupo ou organização que se move, como uma tripulação de piratas, ou uma ordem secreta de feiticeiros que juraram proteger livros de magia proibidos. É útil ser específico quando pensar sobre sua cultura, e usar os quatro aspectos de uma cultura pode ajudá-lo a fazer isso: **Idioma**, **Ambiente**, **Organização** e **Formação**.

### Usando Culturas

Diretores podem usar as regras nessa seção para construir culturas que os jogadores podem escolher para seus personagens. Jogadores podem usar essas regras para construir uma cultura única ou modificar uma cultura existente para seu personagem, colaborando com o Diretor para encontrar o lugar apropriado para aquela cultura no mundo da campanha.

Na maioria dos mundos, pelo menos algumas culturas tem uma linhagem maioritária. As pessoas de Bedegar, um ducado na região de Vasloria em Orden, são em sua maioria humanas. Os povos que habitam a Grande Silva, um reino florestal ao norte de Bedegar, são primariamente elfos silvestres. Contudo, você pode sempre escolher ser parte de uma dessas culturas e de outra linhagem. Um anão criado na cultura da Grande Silva fala yllyrico e provavelmente conhece bastante sobre a natureza, enquanto um anão criado no thanato dos anões de Kal Kalavar fala Zalíaco e pode entender muito de ferraria.

Você pode construir sua cultura um aspecto por vez, ou você pode usar as tabelas abaixo se quiser avaliar amostras de culturas ou criar sua cultura rapidamente. Para criar uma cultura arquetípica para um herói que cresceu cercado principalmente por outros membros de uma linhagem, use ou modifique as opções de aspecto na tabela de Culturas Típicas de Linhagens. (Ressurgidos não aparecem na tabela por que ganham essa linhagem após sua morte.) Se você prefere rapidamente criar uma cultura baseada em um arquétipo cultural, como uma casa de nobreza ou uma tripulação de piratas, use a tabela de Arquétipos Culturais, e depois adicione um idioma que sirva para seu conceito de cultura.

**Culturas Típicas de Linhagens**

| Linhagem          | Idioma       | Ambiente | Organização | Formação  |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- | --------- |

### Por que Construir uma Cultura?

Criar um personagem é mais do que somar suas estatísticas, escolher perícias e habilidades, e registrar essas informações em uma ficha de personagem. Você está criando um herói—um personagem principal em uma história, seja um _one-shot_ ou uma campanha heroica. Pense sobre a personalidade e o passado de quem está criando. É por isso que o jogo deixa você construir uma cultura ao invés de apenas dizer para escolher três perícias e um idioma adicionais. Queremos que os jogadores imaginem seus heróis como personagens complexos e detalhados.

### Benefícios de Cultura

Uma cultura que você escolhe ou cria concede os seguintes benefícios:

- Você conhece o idioma da sua cultura, além de conhecer caeliano.
- Dos aspectos de ambiente, organização e formação da sua cultura, você ganha acesso a perícias. Você pode escolher uma perícia da lista de opções de cada aspecto. (Perícias, no capítulo de Testes tem informações sobre o papel que as perícias tem no jogo.)
- Você ganha vantagem em testes para lembrar de conhecimentos sobre sua cultura, e em testes feitos para influenciar e interagir com pessoas de sua cultura. (veja Vantagens e Desvantagens no capítulo O Básico.)

#### Idioma

O aspecto de idioma da sua cultura determina como as pessoas da sua cultura se comunicam. Idiomas em Orden, abaixo, aborda os diversos idiomas no mundo de Orden, incluindo caeliano—o idioma do império antigo que outrora dominou aquele mundo.

#### Ambiente

O aspecto de ambiente da sua cultura descreve onde as pessoas dessa cultura passam a maior parte do tempo. A sua cultura é concentrada em uma cidade agitada ou pequeno vilarejo? Você passou sua juventude em um monastério remoto? Ou você vagou pela natureza, sem jamais permanecer em algum lugar por muito tempo?

Quando criar uma cultura, escolha seu aspecto de ambiente dentre as seguintes opções: Nomádico, Rural, Isolado, Urbano ou Selvagem. Você ganha opções de perícia do ambiente escolhido. Todos esses ambientes podem ser encontrados em qualquer tipo de terreno, seja na superfície, seja em cavernas subterrâneas; em florestas densas ou mesmo sob as águas.

**Nomádico**

Uma cultura nomádica viaja de lugar a lugar para sobreviver. Membros de culturas nomádicas podem seguir migrações animais ou o clima; viajar para vender mercadorias ou serviços; ou simplesmente aproveitar uma vida agitada, cheia de novas experiências e pessoas. Aqueles que crescem em culturas nomádicas aprendem a viajar pela natureza e a trabalhar em conjunto outras pessoas para sobreviver.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos de exploração ou interpessoal. (Criação Rápida: Navegação)

**Rural**

Uma cultura rural é localizada em um povoado, vilarejo ou outro pequeno reduto colonizado. Pessoas que habitam tais lugares comumente cultivam a terra, comercializam bens e serviços com viajantes de passagem, pescam peixes das águas ou mineram metais e gemas da terra.

Vivendo em meio a uma pequena população, a maioria das pessoas de uma comunidade rural aprende algum ofício e herda o conhecimento essencial para ajudar sua comunidade a sobreviver. Por exemplo, quando uma cultura rural tem apenas um ferreiro, é importante que tenha um aprendiz já aprendendo na forja bem antes que o ferreiro comece a envelhecer. Se o único padre da cidade fica resfriado, as pessoas querem que haja um coroinha pronto para assumir as vestes caso o pior aconteça.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos de criação ou de conhecimento. (Criação Rápida: Natureza.)

**Isolado**

Uma cultura isolada tem por base uma estrutura relativamente pequena—um prédio, uma caverna, entre outras—que interage com outras culturas em raras ocasiões. Tais locais são geralmente prédios ou complexos como monastérios, castelos ou prisões. As pessoas em uma cultura isolada tem pouca ou nenhuma razão para deixar seu lar ou interagir com culturas externas, mas podem ter consciência dessas culturas e de eventos que ocorrem além de seu reduto. Quando pessoas vivem juntas em espaços pequenos, elas tipicamente aprendem a manter uma boa relação. Elas geralmente ficam muito tempo estudando ou em introspecção, já que não há muito mais a se fazer em isolamento.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos interpessoal ou de conhecimento. (Criação Rápida: Ler Pessoas.)

**Urbano**

Uma cultura urbana é sempre concentrada em uma cidade. Tal cultura pode existir entre as paredes de Capital, uma metrópole enorme com uma população cosmopolita; dentro de uma rede de cavernas que contém uma cidade subterrânea; ou em qualquer outro lugar onde muitas pessoas vivem relativamente próximas umas às outras. Pessoas em culturas urbanas geralmente aprendem a efetivamente desviar das demais não só com a finalidade de se movimentar pelas multidões, mas também das maquinações políticas que fazem parte da vida na cidade.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos interpessoal ou de intriga .(Criação Rápida: Atenção.)

**Selvagem**

Uma cultura selvagem não tenta domar o território em que habitam, seja ele um deserto, floresta, pântano, tundra, oceano ou um clima mais exótico. Em vez disso, o povo de tal cultura prospera em meio à natureza, tirando da terra sua subsistência e abrigo. Uma cultura selvagem pode ser um círculo druídico protegendo uma silva remota, um bando de ladrões se escondendo em cavernas no deserto, ou um acampamento de mercenários orcs que chamam montanhas inexploradas de lar. Pessoas em uma cultura selvagem aprendem a usar a terra para tudo que precisam para viver, tipicamente fazendo suas próprias ferramentas, roubas, entre outras coisas.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos de criação ou de exploração. (Criação Rápida: Resiliência.)

#### Organização

O aspecto de organização determina o funcionamento e a liderança de sua comunidade. Você pode ser de um lugar com um governo oficialmente reconhecido e um sistema de leis. Ou sua cultura pode ter se desenvolvido de maneira menos formal, com lideranças que naturalmente alcançaram suas posições sem quaisquer cargos ou juramentos.

Quando construir sua cultura, selecione seu aspecto de organização dentre as seguintes opções: Burocrática ou Comunitária. Você ganha opções de perícia da organização escolhida.

**Burocrática**

Culturas burocráticas são baseadas em lideranças oficiais e leis formalmente registradas. Membros de tais culturas ocasionalmente são classificados de acordo com seu poder perante essas leis, com um menor grupo detendo o poder com base em direito de nascimento, voto popular ou algum outro padrão mensurável oficial. Muitas comunidades burocráticas são governadas por uma pessoa, mas outras podem ser governadas por conselhos. Uma guilda mercante com mestre de guilda, tesoureiro, secretário estatuto de regras e regulamentos para os membros; um lorde feudal que comanda um grupo de cavaleiros, que por sua vez comandam os camponeses que cultivam a terra; e uma sociedade militarizada com patentes e um código que as pessoas precisam acatar são exemplos de culturas burocráticas.

As pessoas que prosperam em culturas burocráticas não apenas seguem as regras. Elas sabem como tirar vantagem dessas regras, seja contornando, alterando ou reinterpretando diretivas para promover seus interesses. Socializar com pessoas responsáveis por essas leis geralmente é aspecto chave dessa abordagem. Outras pessoas em culturas burocráticas se especializam em operar às margens das rigorosas regulamentações que governam a cultura sem serem capturadas.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos interpessoal ou de intriga. (Criação Rápida: Persuadir.)

**Comunitária**

Em uma cultura comunitária, todos os membros são considerados iguais. A comunidade colabora para tomar importantes decisões que afetem a maioria da cultura. Ainda que elejam líderes para executar essas decisões e organizar seus esforços, cada pessoa tem voz relativamente equivalente em como a cultura opera, e todos contribuem para a sobrevivência e prosperidade do grupo. Indivíduos geralmente compartilham os fardos de governar, trabalhar, cuidar das crianças e outros deveres. Uma cooperativa de fazendeiros que cultivam a terra em conjunto sem depender de um nobre, uma cidade de piratas onde cada pessoa faz o que bem quiser, e uma trupe teatral viajante nas quais os membros votem em cada decisão artística e administrativa são todos culturas comunitárias.

Muitas culturas comunitárias operam fora de regiões colonizadas, em áreas selvagens, distritos específicos de um assentamento maior, esgotos de cidades, ruínas perdidas, e outros locais isolados. Ainda que tais culturas sejam inofensivas, seus membros sabem que pessoas de fora podem tentar impor regras a eles se viverem no mesmo local. Po isso, muitas pessoas de culturas comunitárias são focadas em cuidarem de si mesmas e evitarem os perigos que outros grupos podem representar.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dos grupos de criação ou exploração. (Criação Rápida: Pular.)

#### Formação

O aspecto de formação da sua cultura é uma parte mais específica e pessoal da história do seu herói, descrevendo como você foi criado dentro de sua cultura. Você foi treinado para se tornar o próximo arquimago em uma ordem secreta de bruxos, ou para ser o espadachim da guarda pessoal que protege essa organização arcana? Você aprendeu a explorar as profundezas de minas atrás de minérios em um reino de montanha, ou você construía máquinas capazes de cavar mais rápido e mais fundo que qualquer pessoa? Independente de qual seja a sua cultura, a sua formação o torna especial dentro dela.

Selecione o aspecto de formação dessa lista: Acadêmica, Criativa, Operária, Ilegal, Militar ou Nobre. Você ganha opções de perícia da formação escolhida.

**Acadêmica**

Seu herói foi criado por pessoas que colecionam, estudam ou compartilham livros e outros registros. Alguns acadêmicos se especializam em uma área de estudos, como um colégio para bruxos dedicado ao estudo de magia, ou uma igreja que ensina a palavra de um divindade. Pessoas em uma cultura acadêmica aprendem a exercer o poder do conhecimento.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia do grupo de conhecimento. (Criação Rápida: História.)

**Criativa**

Um herói com formação criativa cresceu entre pessoas que criavam arte ou outros bens valiosos o suficiente para comercializar. Uma cultura criativa pode produzir arte como dança, música ou esculturas; ou mercadorias mais práticas como carroças, armas, ferramentas ou construções. Pessoas em tais culturas aprendem o valor da qualidade do artesanato e da atenção a detalhes.

**Opções de Perícia**: A perícia de Música ou Atuar(do grupo interpessoal), ou uma perícia do grupo de criação. (Criação Rápida: Atuar.)

**Operária**

Seu herói passou a infância em uma cultura onde as pessoas trabalhavam para viver. Elas podem ter sido agricultoras, geralmente plantando ou criando animais em uma fazenda. Elas podem ter coletado recursos naturais; seja caçando, preparando armadilhas, cortando madeira ou minerando. Ou podem ter se destacado no trabalho manual de um assentamento ou comércio, pela construção, transporte, carregamento, entre outros. Pessoas de formação operária reconhecem o valor do trabalho duro.

**Opções de Perícia**: A perícia de Forja (do grupo de criação), ou a de Trato Animal (do grupo interpessoal), ou uma perícia do grupo de exploração. (Criação Rápida: Levantar.)

**Ilegal**

Seu herói foi criado entre pessoas que realizavam atividades que outras pessoas—de dentro ou de fora da sua cultura—consideravam ilegais. Uma tripulação de piratas, uma guilda de assassinos ou uma rede de espionagem cometem atos ilegais por dinheiro. Além disso, pessoas sob uma tirania que se envolvem em rebeliões geralmente são consideradas criminosas por seus atos e atividades. Pessoas de uma cultura ilegal geralmente não se importam de quebrar regras quando lhes convém—e são boas em garantir que ninguém descubra.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia do grupo de intriga. (Criação Rápida: Esgueirar.)

**Militar**

Um herói com formação militar foi educado por guerreiros. Eles podem ter sido soldados de um exército regular, um grupo de mercenários, uma guilda de aventureiros caçadores de monstros, ou qualquer outro tipo de pessoa que combata para viver. Heróis com formação militar estão sempre de prontidão em caso de combate—e sabem como terminá-lo.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia dentre essas: Forja, Flecharia (do grupo de criação); Escalar, Resiliência, Montar (do grupo de exploração); Intimidar (do grupo interpessoal); Atenção, Rastrear (do grupo de intriga); Monstros, Estratégia (do grupo de conhecimento).
(Criação Rápida: Intimidar.)

**Nobre**

Seu herói cresceu entre líderes que governam outras pessoas e jogam o jogo da pol´itica para manter seu poder. Muitas famílias são nobres por nascimento, mas algumas culturas tem nobreza adquirida por feitos ou popularidade. Independente disso, heróis com essa formação entendem por que a palavra sussurrada no ouvido certo pode ser mais poderosa que qualquer exército.

**Opções de Perícia**: Uma perícia do grupo interpessoal. (Criação Rápida: Liderar.)

> **Mas eu quero Atenção!**
>
> Se a cultura que você criar não concede uma perícia que você deseja, verifique com seu Diretor a respeito de modificar o que os aspectos da cultura oferecem. Por exemplo, você pode facilmente argumentar que uma cultura com a formação nobre deveria conceder a perícia de Atenção, dado que viver entre pessoas que cobiçam seu poder exige estar atento ao seu entorno.

#### Idioma em Orden

O idioma concedido pela cultura do seu herói molda seu entendimento do mundo e seu relacionamento com as criaturas nele presentes. Essa seção detalha os idiomas de Orden, o mundo base do jogo, mas o Diretor pode usar esses idiomas em seu próprio mundo ou substituir essa lista com sua própria lista de idiomas.

Se seu herói conhece um idioma, ele pode falar, ler, escrever e entender esse idioma.

**Império Caeliano**

O Império Caeliano dominou cinco das oito regiões de Orden 3.000 anos atrás. Durante o auge desse mais recente império humano, todos os humanos (incluindo as pessoas de Vanigar no norte distante, mas não as pessoas de Ix) aprenderam a falar a língua caeliana. Para muitos, especialmente as classes nobres e dos mais abastados, caeliano praticamente substituiu seu idioma nativo.

Passados aproximadamente 1.300 anos da queda do Império Caeliano, os idiomas das diferentes regiões do antigo império estão tendo uma ressurgência. Mesmo assim, a língua caeliana é falada pela maior parte dos humanos na maioria das regiões, em maior ou menor grau.

A maioria das pessoas em Orden consegue falar e entender ao menos um pouco de caeliano, simplesmente pelo império ter sido tão abrangente e poderoso. Qualquer povo que negociava com o império, vivia próximo à suas fronteiras ou sob sua influência eventualmente aprendeu a falar caeliano, includindo anões, draconatos, elfos, hakaan, orcs, polders, reptilianos e goblins. Se uma pessoa fala mais de um idioma em Orden, o segundo idioma é quase sempre caeliano. Todos os personagens de jogador conhecem caeliano! Como resultado, esse idioma imperial é agora coloquialmente referida como "a língua comum"—o idioma que a maioria dos povos de Orden têm em comum.

**Idiomas Extantes**

Pessoas tem falado, sinalizado e escrito em Orden por pelo menos trinta mil anos, mas a maioria dos idiomas ancestrais do mundo estão mortos atualmente. Muitos foram esquecidos. Outros foram falados por pessoas que jamais desenvolveram escrita, prevenindo esses idiomas de serem preservados. Além disso, muitos idiomas que foram preservados pela escrita não deixaram idiomas descendentes, então ninguém sabe quais sons aquela escrita representava.

Os idiomas na tabela de **Idiomas por Linhagem** são os mais comuns dos ativamente falados e sinalizados por partes significativas da população em Orden. A tabela **Idiomas Humanos de Orden** mostra os idiomas dominantes nos territórios humanocêntricos de suas regiões. A maioria dos idiomas é associado a uma linhagem ou cultura específica, mas ser membro de uma linhagem não faz com que você automaticamente faça parte da cultura associada à qual o idioma está ligado. Por exemplo, se seu herói orc foi criado em uma cultura élfica, você provavelmente fala um idioma élfico, e pode não ter aprendido Kalliak.

A maioria dos idiomas tem nomes casuais ou coloquiais. Por exemplo, muitas pessoas em Orden chamam Kalliak de “Orc” and Hyrállico “Élfico,” mas qualquer sábio sabe que há muitos idiomas orc ou élficos, como há muitas idiomas humanos.

Cada idioma extante tem uma versão falada, sinalizada e escrita. Quando aprende um idioma, você sabe falar, sinalizar e ler esse idioma.

**Usos de Idiomas**

**Hyrállico** é o idioma principal dos altos elfos em Orden. Ainda que seja jovem para um idioma élfico, hyrállico é mais antigo que quase todas os outros idiomas culturais modernos, exceto os dos anões. Como resultado, enquanto qualquer pessoa que vive próxima ou negocia com culturas humanas provavelmente fala um pouco de caeliano, a maioria dos nobres de todas as linhagens faz questão que seus filhos ou descendentes falem hyrállico. Caeliano é um idioma novo do ponto de vista de várias culturas, enquanto hyrállico é considerado culto e tradicional como um idioma de diplomacia.

**Yllyrico** é o idioma cultural dos elfos silvestres, e também o idioma comum entre aqueles que defendem e protegem as florestas naturais de Orden.

Em qualquer documento sobre o funcionamento de máquinas, alvenaria ou geologia, você tem grandes chances de encontrar uma grande quantidade de jargões usando **Zalíaco**, o mais popular idioma dos anões. Mesmo quando tais textos não são totalmente escritos em Zalíaco, eles usam bastante o idioma dos anões para descrever ideias complexas e exóticas.

Da mesma forma que Zalíaco é usado para engenharia, os contratos não são exclusivamente escritos em **Anjali** , idioma dominante das Sete Cidades do Inferno, mas boa parte dos jargões jurídicos em qualquer contrato, bem como parte da linguagem dos tribunais, inclui muitas palavras em anjali. As pessoas são rigorosas com os detalhes nas Sete Cidades, e isso faz seu idioma popular entre advogados.

Da mesma forma que criaturas inteligentes em Orden que vivem ou fazem comércio com outras culturas usam caeliano como um idioma comum, os habitantes do Mundo Inferior, a Escuridão Abaixo de Tudo, geralmente falam **Variac**, o idioma dos falantes sem voz.

**Idiomas Mortos**

Para um herói aventureiro com a ambição de criar grandes obras ou redescobrir conhecimento perdido, ser capaz de ler escrita antiga é muito útil. Boa parte do conhecimento do passado só foi registrado em tomos antigos e pergaminhos escritos em idiomas que nenhuma cultura moderna usa.

A maioria dessas escrituras antigas foram redigidas por pessoas que esperavam que outras pessoas as lessem. O conhecimento pode ter sido mantido em segredo por não ser compartilhado com ninguém de fora da faculdade ou culto dos membros que o escreveram originalmente, mas o texto não foi escrito com a intenção de ser de difícil leitura ou compreensão. Tais escrituras não foram escritas em código—apenas em um idioma que as pessoas pararam de usar há muito tempo.

Sábios podem reconstruir muitos desses idiomas pelo aprendizado de quais idiomas modernos descendem deles, e pela comparação com idiomas relacionados do mesmo período que podem ter sobrevivido. Traduzir esses idiomas antigos é extremamente útil para criações e pesquisas.

A tabela de **Idiomas Mortas** mostra algumas desses idiomas antigos de Orden, e os idiomas modernos relacionados a eles.

## Carreiras

Ser um herói não é um trabalho. É uma convocação. Mas antes de recebe esse chamado, você tinha um trabalho ou vocação que lhe permitia arcar com suas despesas. Agradeça aos deuses por ela, já que as experiências que teve na sua carreira agora ajudam a salvar seus aliados e matar monstros.

### Perguntas de Carreira

As carreiras nessa seção não detalham os trabalhos que representam. Presumimos que saiba o básico sobre o que um Artesão, Criminoso ou Gladiador faz da vida. Ainda assim, cada carreira inclui uma lista de perguntas a se considerar para definir os detalhes mais específicos da carreira do seu herói. Por exemplo, se escolheu a carreira Artesão, uma das perguntas é: "O que você criava?"

Você não precisa responder essas perguntas, mas elas ajudam a moldar uma imagem mais completa do seu herói. Se as responder, considere compartilhar as respostas com seu Diretor, para que pense em formas de incluir esses detalhes no jogo. Diretores já tem bastante com o que se preocupar, mas eles certamente não conseguem criar momentos dramáticos com a sua história de fundo se você nunca contou essa história para eles.

### Benefícios de Carreira

Sua carreira descreve como era sua vida antes de se tornar um herói. Quando seleciona uma carreira, você ganha uma série de benefícios que são detalhados na descrição da carreira.

#### Perícias

Cada carreira concede duas or três perícias, detalhadas na seção de Perícias do Capítulo de Testes.

#### Idiomas

Algumas carreiras permitem a você aprender idiomas adicionais, escolhidos entre os disponíveis em Idioma em Orden, acima.

#### Renome

Algumas carreiras aumentam seu valor de renome (que tem valor inicial de 0). Veja Renome no Capítulo de Recompensas para mais informações.

#### Riqueza

Algumas carreiras aumentam seu valor de Riqueza (que tem valor inicial de 1). Veja Riqueza no Capítulo de Recompensas para mais informações.

#### Pontos de Projeto

Algumas carreiras concedem pontos de projeto que pode gastar em projetos de criação e de pesquisa (veja o Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre). Esses pontos de projeto podem ser divididos entre vários projetos, mas não podem ser utilizados mais de uma vez. Você sempre precisa atender aos demais pré-requisitos de um projeto para começá-lo.

À discrição do Diretor, sua carreira pode deixar que inicie o jogo com materiais necessários para um ou mais projetos, para que possa imediatamente gastar seus pontos nesses projetos—possivelmente antes da aventura começar! Isso é especialmente útil para personagens que participarão de uma única aventura. Do contrário, você pode guardar os pontos e gastá-los quando iniciar um projeto.

#### Aprimoramento

Sua carreira concede um aprimoramento de tipo específico—um recurso especial que permite customizar seu personagem, focado em situações fora de combate. Veja o Capítulo de Aprimoramentos para mais informações.

### Evento Desencadeador

Cada carreira tem uma lista de eventos desencadeadores, cada um deles sugerindo um possível motivo pelo qual você abandonou sua carreira, virou as costas para uma vida provavelmente mais segura e confortável , e pegou a espada (ou machado, ou varinha) para se tornar um herói aventureiro. Cada evento desencadeador representa um acontecimento de mudança de vida que pode ter motivado seu herói a mudar de rumo, se tornando uma pessoas que arrisca tudo para salvar os outros.

Você pode fazer um lançamento ou escolher um evento desencadeador da tabela que acompanha cada carreira. Você também pode usar a tabela da sua carreira (ou de outra carreira) como inspiração, junto com seu Diretor, para criar um evento desencadeador único.

#### O que foi tirado de você?

Durante seu evento desencadeador, algo foi tirado de você. Pode ter sido um objeto físico, como uma espada herança de família, ou um medalhão que comprova sua ascendência real. Talvez uma pessoa que você amava foi assassinada, sequestrada ou amaldiçoada. Pode ter sido algo mais profundo ou abstrato, como uma chance de ser feliz, de acreditar no futuro, na bondade fundamental ou a perda de um objetivo de vida.

É possível que você esteja obcecado em recuperar o que perdeu. Ou então, talvez seja impossível recuperar o que perdeu, mas você quer evitar que outras pessoas tenham o mesmo tipo de perda. Quem sabe sua perda te deixou em uma condição onde ajudar os outros é a única coisa que dá sentido à sua vida. Seja como for, a perda que sofreu é parte do que te motiva a ser um herói. Registre o que foi tirado de você em sua ficha de personagem, e conte para o seu Diretor.

### Carreiras de A a Z

As carreiras que seu personagem pode escolher são apresentadas em ordem alfabética.

#### Agente

Você trabalhou como espião para um governo ou organização. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Para quem trabalhava?
- Quem espionava?
- Quem não deveria saber sua verdadeira identidade e lealdade, mas sabe?
- Quem você "queimou" ou abandonou para cumprir com seu trabalho?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

**Perícias:** A perícia Esgueirar do grupo de intriga, mais uma perícia do grupo interpessoal e uma outra perícia do grupo de intriga. (Criação Rápida: Disfarce, Mentir, Esgueirar.)

**Idiomas**: Dois idiomas

**Aprimoramento:** Um aprimoramento de intriga. (Criação Rápida: Cara Comum.)

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Renegado:** Durante uma missão perigosa de espionagem, as coisas deram errado. Ainda que tenha escapado com vida, a missão foi um fracasso público graças a má informação que sua agência te deu. Eles negaram que trabalha pra eles, e você fugiu. Trabalhar como herói te permite sobreviver e limpar seu nome.                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | **Anônimo:** Sua identidade sempre foi escondida. Era uma forma de proteger as pessoas mais próximas, por que espionar os poderosos tinha certos perigos. Então seu mundo desmoronou quando um agente inimigo te desmascarou, fazendo com que perdesse tudo—sua privacidade, sustento, família, tudo perdido em um piscar de olhos. Em vez de se esconder, você se tornou um herói para proteger os inocentes em nome de tudo que perdeu. |
| 3   | **Autônomo:** Houve uma época de sua vida onde vendia informações à quem pagasse mais. Seus atos não eram legitimados por nenhuma organização, mas era bem relacionado o suficiente para negociar segredos. Política não lhe interessava até até que uma informação que vendeu causou um efeito cascata de danos que terminou por destruir o local que chamava de lar. Você se tornou um herói para compensar pelo seu passado.           |
| 4   | **Informado:** Após anos cultivando uma rica lista de informantes, um deles arriscou tudo para expor os planos hediondos de indivíduos poderosos. Você prometeu proteção ao seu informante, mas sua agência não o protegeu. Você cortou relações com seu empregador e prometeu manter sua palavra como herói.                                                                                                                             |
| 5   | **Espiões e Amantes:** Durante uma missão de infiltração, você se apaixonou por alguém do lado inimigo, que descobriu que você era um agente duplo. Mesmo que você tenha jurado que seus sentimentos eram reais, a enganação foi demais para a pessoa ignorar e ela te expôs, rejeitou ou morreu por sua causa. Você deixou a espionagem para se tornar um herói sem nada a esconder.                                                     |
| 6   | **Vira-casaca:** Você viveu sua vida em serviço a um país ou organização que pensava compartilhar dos seus valores. Durante uma missão de infiltração, descobriu que era tudo mentira. Independente de ter confrontado seus superiores ou ter sido exposto, você foi despojado de suas medalhas de serviço antes de se tornar um verdadeiro herói.                                                                                        |

#### Aristocrata

Carreira? Quem precisa de carreira quando nasce com dinheiro? Ou casa com alguém rico! Ou engana pessoas por dinheiro! Seja qual for o caso, você não precisava trabalhar por causa da riqueza geracional (de alguém). Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Como se tornou aristocrata?
- O que fazia para passar o tempo?
- Quais aristocratas e pessoas que trabalhavam para você eram seus melhores amigos e maiores inimigos?
- Que lembrança sentimental da sua antiga propriedade ainda carrega, e o que significa para você?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

**Perícias:** Uma perícia do grupo interpessoal e uma perícia do grupo de conhecimento. (Criação Rápida: Gabar-se, Sociedade.)

**Idiomas**: Um idioma

**Renome:** +1

**Riqueza:** +1

**Aprimoramento:** Um aprimoramento de conhecimento. (Criação Rápida: Eu Já Li Sobre Esse Lugar.)

| d6  | Evento Desencadeador                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Dinheiro de Sangue:** Quando chegou na idade adulta, ouviu rumores desagradáveis sobre a fortuna da sua família até descobrir que sua riqueza teve como preço o sofrimento de outras pessoas. Independente de ter revelado o segredo ou não, você deixou seu título de nobreza para trás para se tornar um herói.                                                                                                    |
| 2   | **Vida Abençoada:** Seja por algum poder supernatural ou persuasão inata, você tinha a capacidade de enganar outros aristocratas. Fazia isso por diversão. Quando foi descoberto, perdeu seu status. Independente de ter cumprido pena ou escapado da punição, você decidiu se reabilitar e se tornar um herói.                                                                                                        |
| 3   | **Herança:** Os guardiães que incutiram em você as virtudes de fazer o bem foram assassinados em um roubo insignificante. Ainda que você tenha herdado sua riqueza, isso não amenizou a culpa que sentiu por não ter conseguido impedir o crime. Você decidiu usar sua riqueza para financiar sua vida como herói, seja publicamente ou usando uma identidade secreta.                                                 |
| 4   | **Privilegiado:** A vida fora da sua mansão nunca lhe interessou. Você tinha tudo que queria. Por isso se surpreendeu quando os camponeses vieram depor sua família. Você escapou por pouco, e pela primeira vez conheceu o mundo. Isso causou que se tornasse um herói, lutando contra desigualdades.                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | **Nobre Mendigo:** Procurando uma pausa dos deveres da nobreza, você encontrou um sósia para trocar de identidades. Funcionou tão bem que se tornou um hábito trocar sempre que estava entediado. Infelizmente, sua contraparte passou a te imitar tão bem que convenceram todos que você era um impostor. Você perdeu contato com sua família, mas agora segue o caminho heroico livre das pompas da sua antiga vida. |
| 6   | **Segredo Malévolo:** Um de seus pais faleceu quando você era um bebê e o outro se casou novamente anos depois. Então esse progenitor morreu em circunstâncias suspeitas. Seu cônjuge expulsou você, e você foi banido (e possivelmente caçado). Recuperando-se da tragédia, você agora busca corrigir os erros do mundo.                                                                                              |

#### Pedinte

Você vivia indo a tavernas, encruzilhadas, ruas de cidades ou outras áreas movimentadas pedindo dinheiro ou comida. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Quais circunstâncias desfavoráveis fizeram com que se tornasse um pedinte?
- Onde pedia esmolas?
- Quem tratava você mal?
- Quem foi mais gentil com você?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

**Perícias:** A perícia Boatos do grupo de conhecimento, mais uma perícia do grupo de exploração e uma perícia do grupo interpessoal. (Criação Rápida: Empatizar, Resiliência, Boatos.)

**Idiomas**: Dois idiomas

**Aprimoramento:** Um aprimoramento interpessoal (Criação Rápida: Leitura Corporal.)

| d6  | Evento Desencadeador                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Campeão:** Você nunca esteve satisfeito com sua situação. Ver outro amigo se perder por circunstâncias evitáveis foi a gota d'água. Você recolheu o pouco que tinha e partiu para se tornar um herói, determinado a fazer mudanças reais para os esquecidos pela sociedade.                                                                                                                              |
| 2   | **Terrores Noturnos:** Alguma coisa matou outros pedintes. Ela veio à noite, você mal a viu, mas percebeu que não era uma criatura natural. Você sobreviveu se escondendo, ou talvez a criatura ignorou você por motivos desconhecidos. Você ainda tem pesadelos, e mata monstros para que ninguém mais passe por isso.                                                                                    |
| 3   | **Uma Boa Ação:** Você entrou em conflito com a guarda local por estar no lugar errado enquanto eles estavam de mau humor. Um herói que passava interviu a seu favor, envergonhando os guardas para que deixassem você em paz e lhe dando ouro suficiente para reerguer-se. Essa gentileza acendeu uma chama em você. Você comprou equipamentos usados e partiu para retribuiu a gentileza.                |
| 4   | **Precioso:** Não importa a que ponto chegou, havia um pertence do qual você não se separava, independente do seu valor. Quando um ladrão roubou o objeto, você o perseguiu até um local que não reconhecia mais. Surpreso, você percebeu que não tinha desejo de retornar de onde veio. Você seguiu em frente sem olhar pra trás.                                                                         |
| 5   | **Caridade Estranha:** Um transeunte largou alguma coisa no seu copo. Quando contava o que recebeu no dia, você achou uma moeda mágica entre os cobres. Você sabia imediatamente que era especial. Quando outros pedintes—que pensava serem seus amigos—tentaram matar você por ela, você matou vários deles em legítima defesa antes de fugir, deixando para trás a única comunidade da qual fazia parte. |
| 6   | **Testemunha:** Você testemunhou algo que não deveria. Pessoas te matariam se soubessem, e podem ainda estar procurando você. Você segue em movimento, com medo de ficar em um lugar por muito tempo para que não te alcancem. Talvez se você se fosse renomado, poderia se tornar intocável e finalmente contar o que aconteceu sem medo.                                                                 |

#### Artesão

Você fazia e vendia mercadorias. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- O que você criava?
- Quem te ensinou esse ofício?
- Havia alguma criação específica pela qual você era conhecido?
- Você tinha uma loja, ou viajava para vender suas mercadorias?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

**Perícias:** Duas perícias do grupo de criação. (Criação Rápida: Forja, Carpintaria.)

**Idiomas**: Um idioma

**Pontos de Projeto:** 240

**Aprimoramento:** Um aprimoramento de criação. (Criação Rápida: Área de Especialização.)

| d6  | Evento Desencadeador                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Continuar o Trabalho:** Um grande herói era fã das coisas que você criava e comissionou a criação de uma obra-prima. Enquanto trabalhava nessa comissão, vocês ficaram amigos. O dia em que terminou a obra foi o dia em que o herói desapareceu. Para honrar seu legado, você se tornou herói com a intenção de terminar o que seu amigo começou.                                   |
| 2   | **Inspirado:** Enquanto viajava vendendo mercadorias, você foi atacado por trolls bandidos. Um deles roubou um item de uma pessoa que você ama—ou talvez matou essa pessoa—mas os demais foram espantados ou mortos por um grupo de heróis. Vendo a facilidade com que os heróis lidaram com os bandidos inspirou você a seguir esse caminho.                                          |
| 3   | **Roubado:** Uma gangue roubou suas mercadorias e machucou várias pessoas que trabalhavam com você. Você se tornou herói para prevenir que outros passem por essa indignidade, para se vingar do crime ou para encontrar os ladrões e recuperar seus bens.                                                                                                                             |
| 4   | **Paixão Roubada:** Seus pais desencorajavam seu talento artístico, tentando focar seus interesses no negócio da família. Você não aceitou abandonar a arte e seguiu criando em segredo. Com raiva por terem descoberto sua desobediência, eles venderam suas criações para um viajante. Você deixou sua cidade procurando sua arte perdida e encorajando outros a viverem livremente. |
| 5   | **Honra Manchada:** Um novo cliente comissionou uma peça de arte, mas após completa, se recusaram a pagar e alegaram que eles criaram a peça. Você foi acusado de plágio e expulso da cidade. Para você, heroísmo é uma forma de restaurar seu nome e honra.                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | **Amaldiçoado:** Você teve muito sucesso que fez com que um rival inescrupuloso te amaldiçoasse. Por um tempo, tudo o que criava era arruinado. Você quebrou a maldição se aventurando, e ao fazê-lo, descobriu um novo propósito que agora o define.                                                                                                                                  |

#### Criminoso

Você trabalhava como bandido, insurgente, contrabandista, fora-da-Lei, ou até mesmo como assassino. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Quais crimes cometeu, e porquê?
- Alguém te ajudava nessas atividades ilícitas?
- Em qual crime fracassou?

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Aquisição de Antiguidades:** Você roubava, contrabandeava e vendia antiguidades. Na pressa de fazer uma venda rápida, você não examinou totalmente um cliente, e ele consequentemente roubou seu depósito. Quando os itens que roubava foram tirados de você, você percebeu o dano que causava. Agora se aventura para achar esses itens e devolvê-los a quem pertencem.               |
| 2   | **Penitência:** O último crime que cometeu causou a morte de alguém ou a destruição de algo que amava. Para compensar pela perda que causou, você deixou o crime para trás e se tornou um herói.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | **Padre Amigo:** Você foi para a prisão por seus crimes e eventualmente escapou. Um padre te acolheu e protegeu da justiça, convencido que sua alma não era corrupta. Ele nunca julgou você pelo seu passado, falando apenas do futuro. Eventualmente, o padre faleceu, lhe dizendo as últimas palavras que te inspiraram a se tornar um herói.                                          |
| 4   | **Influência das Sombras:** Você passou anos chantageando e manipulando nobres por influência e riqueza até um de seus esquemas dar errado. Você foi exposto publicamente, e após escapar por pouco, reavaliou sua vida. Sob uma nova identidade, você trabalha como herói e torce pra ninguém investigar seu passado de perto.                                                          |
| 5   | **Apenas Sobrevivência:** Roubar era uma forma de sobrevivência para você, e não te definia—ao menos era o que pensava. Porém quando seus crimes causaram danos a inocentes, você sabia que poderia ser uma pessoa melhor. Você deixou aquela vida, mas suas habilidades ainda são úteis.                                                                                                |
| 6   | **Resistir à Tirania:** Quando um tirano tomou o poder na sua terra natal, começou a reprimir todos os criminosos com invasões e execuções públicas. O tipo de crime não importava, trombadinhas e pedintes enfrentavam o machado junto dos assassinos. Depois de perder vários amigos, você decidiu se juntar à resistência—não só contra esse tirano, mas contra qualquer autoritário. |

#### Discípulo

Você trabalhava em uma igreja, templo ou outra instituição religiosa como parte do clero. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Quais deuses ou santos sua instituição venerava?

- Quais eram suas responsabilidades como discípulo?
- Como sua instituição era vista pelos membro da cultura local?

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Anjo da Guarda:** Seduzido por uma fé maligna, seu culto estava para causar horrores pelo mundo quando um anjo (figurativo ou literal) interveio. Ele te convenceu a impedir os planos do seu culto. Agora você segue o caminho do anjo que lhe mostrou o bom caminho.                                                                                                                                            |
| 2   | **Dogma:** Ainda que tenha se juntado a uma instituição religiosa sob orientação de um mentor generoso, outros membros se tornaram cada vez mais fanáticos em suas convicções. Seu mentor tentou ser a voz da razão contra a maré de ódio e foi julgado e executado como herege. Deixando a instituição para trás, você se tornou herói para seguir as crenças que preza.                                           |
| 3   | **Liberdade de Crença:** Seu templo foi destruído em um conflito religioso. Os líderes da instituição buscaram retaliar, mas você via nessas ações um ciclo de destruição sem fim que causaria mais conflitos. Em vez disso, você se tornou herói para proteger a liberdade de crença, para que todos os fiéis possam praticar sua fé sem medo.                                                                     |
| 4   | **Fé Perdida:** Você dedicou sua vida ao ministério dos doentes e necessitados, além de outras obras de caridade. Repetidas vezes, tragédias sem explicação atingiram as pessoas a quem servia. Suas orações não eram atendidas, e seus esforços desvalorizados. Eventualmente, perdeu a fé em um poder superior e deixou sua igreja ou templo para fazer o bem sem nenhum vínculo religioso.                       |
| 5   | **Experiência de Quase-Morte:** Enquanto servia sua instituição religiosa, você quase morreu em um acidente. Quando acordou, havia perdido toda a memória de ter servido à igreja ou templo. Ainda que os clérigos te encorajassem a permanecer, você partiu para forjar um novo caminho. Seu senso de altruísmo—incutido pelo seu passado ou uma parte natural de você—guiam sua vida.                             |
| 6   | **Fé Dizimada:** A organização religiosa da qual fazia parte se tornou corrupta. Usou seu status na comunidade para acumular riqueza através dos dízimos, enquanto seus líderes buscavam cargos políticos. Durante uma estiagem, a instituição acumulou recursos e se recusou a prestar auxílio, resultando em muitas mortes. Você se tornou herói para lutar contra esse tipo de corrupção e honrar os que perdeu. |

#### Explorador

Você se aventurou em áreas inexploradas e levava sua vida como cartógrafo, pesquisador, garimpeiro ou caçador de tesouros. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Qual lenda ou rumor você procurava mas nunca encontrou?
- Qual foi sua maior descoberta?

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Despertar:** Em uma área inexplorada, você acordou algum horror desconhecido. Consequentemente, você se tornou herói para por fim ao mal que libertou e manter outros perigos sob controle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | **Pesquisa Perdida:** Você fez uma importante mas perigosa descoberta sobre um tesouro ou ritual antigo que pode causar grande destruição. Então o impensável aconteceu quando suas anotações de pesquisa foram roubadas por um colega inescrupuloso, espião ou caçador de tesouros. Você agora procura pelo ladrão, e qualquer outro que use tais descobertas para o mal.                                                                                                                  |
| 3   | **Nada Pertence ao Museu:** Explorar terras distantes para coletar artefatos valiosos para instituições culturais era seu modo de vida. Porém, quando pessoas morreram tentando recuperar um dos objetos que roubou, você percebeu a verdade. Seu trabalho fazia parte de um problema maior, de roubo cultural, e o melhor lugar para esses objetos não é em um museu, mas com as pessoas que os criaram. Você se tornou herói para retornar o que foi roubado e proteger outros de roubos. |
| 4   | **Refutado:** Você mergulhava em masmorras e lugares distantes os estudando-os em livros. Você era um explorador que nunca sentiu a necessidade de enfrentar os mesmos perigos que seus pares. Então sua teoria sobre um mundo perdido lhe custou sua reputação e deu o ímpeto para se aventurar e lutar por aqueles que tem ideias diferentes.                                                                                                                                             |
| 5   | **Inquietude:** Você se imaginava um observador e operava por um código de conduta. Você jurou nunca interferir com um grupo o expondo a sua tecnologia, conhecimento ou valores. Porém, quando confrontado por um dilema moral, você quebrou o código ou cruzou os braços— e sofreu as consequências. Durante esse incidente, você perdeu seu diário de observação mas se tornou o herói que recusa ignorar o mal.                                                                         |
| 6   | **Vento nas Suas Velas:** Como explorador marítimo, você vivia para mapear rumos desconhecidos. Ainda que viagens em alto mar fossem repletas de perigos, o destino sempre o recompensou com riquezas, conhecimento ou outros benefícios. Porém, sua maré de sorte acabou quando seu navio foi destruído por piratas ou outras forças inimigas. Agora você protege os que buscam livre passagem enquanto também espera vingar sua tripulação.                                               |

#### Fazendeiro

Você cultivava plantas ou criava animais. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Você era dono da terra que cultivava, ou trabalhava para alguém?
- Com quais plantas e animais você trabalhava?
- Quem mais trabalhava com você?
- Qual mau presságio você testemunhou que causou uma má colheita?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Praga:** Uma praga terrível assolou sua terra natal, apodrecendo a colheita e adoecendo os animais. Ninguém sabe se a praga teve origem natural ou foi algo maligno, mas você partiu em busca de uma forma de livrar a terra dessa miséria.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2   | **Entediado:** Você sempre quis mais do que coletar ovos e ordenhar vacas. Você tinha um diário secreto com seus sonhos, cheio de tudo o que desejava. Quando seus pais o encontraram, o queimaram e disseram para não ficar imaginando coisas. Por isso, você recolheu o que pode e deixou todo o resto para trás, buscando uma vida de aventura.                                                                       |
| 3   | **Amaldiçoado:** Enquanto arava o campo, encontrou algo na terra. Talvez fosse uma arma lascada ou amassada, uma joia antiga, ou algo absolutamente único. Animado pela descoberta, você mostrou para um mente querido, mas quando ele o tocou, algo ruim aconteceu. Você agora sabe que foi uma maldição causada pelo item, mas não sabe por que afetou seu ente querido e não você. Você partiu em busca de respostas. |
| 4   | **Tempos Difíceis:** Sua fazenda sempre foi próspera, até esses últimos anos. Mudanças climáticas reduziram sua colheita até que não pode pagar o tributo para o nobre local. Seus soldados levaram o que tinha de valor, incluindo uma preciosa herança de família. Você abandonou a fazenda para buscar uma vida melhor.                                                                                               |
| 5   | **Arrasado:** Seus animais foram mortos, suas plantações e casa foram queimadas. Os responsáveis podem ter sido bandidos errantes, saqueadores de um reino vizinho, ou contratados por uma fazenda rival. Quem quer que sejam, deixaram você sem nada. Você não conseguia imaginar recomeçar do zero, então se tornou herói para proteger outras pessoas desse tipo de vilania.                                          |
| 6   | **Roubado:** Sua família criava cavalos—belas criaturas que não tinham rivais nas pistas ou listas de torneios. Quando um nobre local fez uma proposta pelo seu garanhão premiado, seu pai recusou. O nobre o matou e roubou o cavalo. Sem o garanhão, a linha de sangue renomada terá fim. Você pretende recuperar o cavalo e vingar seu pai.                                                                           |

#### Gladiador

No passado, você divertia as massas com exibições chamativas de violência na arena. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Quais eram seu nome e persona como gladiador?
- Quem era seu maior rival?
- O que aconteceu durante a sua luta mais famosa?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

| d6  | Evento Desencadeador                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Traído:** Um chefe criminoso local ofereceu dinheiro para que você entregasse sua próxima luta, prometendo que você sobreviveria e receberia uma parte das apostas. Você fez a sua parte—o que tornou a punhalada nas costas após a luta ainda mais surpreendente. Você acordou em uma cova rasa, quase morto, e pronto para buscar justiça.                                                                       |
| 2   | **Vaiado:** Enquanto comemorava uma vitória nas areias da arena, uma voz gritou entre os aplausos: "Essa violência é apenas para se exibir. Você deveria sentir vergonha. Há pessoas que precisam de você—das suas habilidades!" Por que essa voz soou tão clara, tão familiar? Você nunca viu a pessoa que falou, mas foi impactado pelo que disseram. No próximo dia, você fugiu da arena para se tornar um herói. |
| 3   | **Voluntário:** Você amava lutas de gladiadores quando criança, encantado pelas demonstrações de bravura e ousadia, sem considerar o que acontecia com os competidores após as lutas. Quando um amigo foi acusado injustamente e sentenciado a competir, você tomou o seu lugar. Depois de ver como era a vida dos forçados a lutar, você sobreviveu a sua pena e resolveu proteger os injustamente condenados.      |
| 4   | **Novos Desafios:** Você conquistou todos o títulos possíveis. Derrotou todos os oponentes que aceitaram enfrentá-lo na arena. Sua batalha final com seu rival terminou com a sua vitória—e você ainda estava insatisfeito. Há outros oponentes mais fortes fora da arena, e você pretende encontrá-los.                                                                                                             |
| 5   | **Compaixão de Herdeiro:** Você nasceu nobre, mas a natureza dúbia e gananciosa da sua família fez com que buscasse sua própria sorte na arena. Você viu como competidores trazidos pelas circunstâncias e não por escolha sofriam. Doou tudo o que pode do dinheiro de sua família para ajudar os desfavorecidos, e partiu para fazer a diferença nesse mundo cruel.                                                |
| 6   | **Lar de Guerreiros:** O orfanato onde você foi criado secretamente fornecia gladiadores para a arena. Forçado a lutar contra muitos amigos de infância quando adulto, você jurou destruir a arena e liberar outras vítimas. Você se tornou um libertador, dedicado a acabar com a opressão até seu último fôlego.                                                                                                   |

- Onde você e seus colegas iam para relaxar depois do expediente?
- Que aspecto do trabalho era mais difícil pra você?

| 1   | **Sentinela das Profundezas:** Passar os dias limpando e fazendo manutenção no esgoto não traz muitas amizades, mas você tinha a companhia dos ratos. Você lutava com os monstros que caçavam seus companheiros, que outras pessoas preferiam ignorar. Depois de deixar os esgotos seguros para os ratos, decidiu levar seus talentos para a superfície e servir outros humanoides que apreciem seus esforços da mesma forma. |
| 2   | **Desastre:** Um desastre, como um desmoronamento, incêndio florestal ou maremoto, atingiu a equipe da qual era responsável. Você salvou tantos quanto pôde, mas carrega consigo o peso dos que não conseguiu salvar. Você se tornou herói para salvar tantas pessoas quanto puder, jurando que o que aconteceu com Você não acontecerá novamente.                                                                            |
| 3   | **Vergonha:** Um nobre para quem você trabalhava reclamou publicamente da qualidade do seu trabalho—mais de uma vez. Finalmente, você chegou ao limite. Jurou seguir um novo caminho e mostrar a esse nobre que é muito mais do que ele pensa.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 4   | **Vivendo o Sonho:** Você trabalhava com um bom amigo, e durante o serviço sempre fantasiavam sobre como seria pegar a estrada como heróis aventureiros... algum dia. Você não esperava que seu amigo ficaria doente e faleceria. Agora chegou a hora de viver aquele sonho por vocês dois.                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Luz Brilhante:** Você matinha um farol nos penhascos tempestuosos do seu vilarejo, junto de seu mentor. Em um dia ensolarado, seu mentor desapareceu. Encontrando apenas um caderno misterioso repleto de suas reflexões sobre o sobrenatural, você partiu para descobrir o que aconteceu. Os rastros esfriaram por enquanto, então está ajudando outras pessoas a encontrarem desaparecidos.                               |
| 6   | **Devagar e Sempre:** Você trabalhava silenciosamente enquanto seu chefe cruelmente levava os seus colegas à exaustão, fazendo com que se esforçasse mais para ajudá-los. Porém, quando o chefe passou do ponto e matou um amigo seu, você liderou uma revolta contra ele. Esse foi o início da sua vida de aventuras.                                                                                                        |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Perde de Memória:** Enquanto praticava um feitiço, sua inexperiência fez com que a magia saísse pela culatra e sua memória fosse apagada, deixando apenas fragmentos de quem você era. Determinado a lembrar do seu passado, você agora se dedica a ajudar as pessoas, esperando que suas ações gerem lembranças ou que encontre uma forma de reverter o feitiço.                                     |
| 2   | **Magia de Amizade:** Como sinal do seu status como melhor aluno, recebeu de seu mentor um familiar mágico como animal de estimação. Outro aprendiz invejoso capturou o familiar e fugiu pela noite. Atormentado pela ausência de seu familiar, você se aventura para encontrar seu amigo sequestrado e prevenir outros de sentirem esse tipo de perda.                                                 |
| 3   | **Mago Desaparecido:** Um dia você acordou e o mago para o qual trabalhava tinha sumido. Ele não levou nenhum pertence, e não havia sinais de crime—apenas o cheiro de enxofre em seus aposentos. Você partiu em sua jornada e tem os procurado desde então.                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | **Pesadelo Encarnado:** Suas tentativas em magia sempre foram imprevisíveis. Um mago poderoso prometeu ajudá-lo a obter o controle. Durante o treinamento, um pesadelo terrível causou uma erupção mágica em seu corpo que puxou o monstro dos seus pesadelos para o mundo real. O pesadelo escapou. Você partiu, buscando destruir essa abominação.                                                    |
| 5   | **De Outro Mundo:** Enquanto estudava magia, você acidentalmente transportou-se do seu mundo original para esse. Agora você está preso aqui, torcendo para encontrar textos antigos ou tesouros mágicos poderosos que podem te levar para casa. Então que seja uma vida de aventura!                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | **Poder Supremo:** O mago para quem trabalhava era um velhinho simpático, mas a magia básica que ensinava sempre parecia ser uma parte pequena de algo bem maior. Quando conheceu um elementalista aventureiro, percebeu que pegar a estrada como herói é a única forma de aprimorar e aperfeiçoar suas habilidades. Você renunciou como aprendiz e passou a trilhar o caminho heroico no dia seguinte. |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Plateia Amaldiçoada:** Durante uma apresentação, você testemunhou horrorizado a platéia ser subitamente tomada por uma maldição que fez com que se desintegrassem perante seus olhos. Você não sabe o que aconteceu, mas procurar uma resposta rapidamente o levou a lugares onde apenas heróis ousam ir.                                                                                                                              |
| 2   | **Crédito Falso:** Após uma apresentação ruim, você encontrou o roteiro de uma peça bem escrita em seu camarim. A nota que o acompanhava pedia que caso produzisse a peça, desse crédito ao autor. Após uma ótima atuação, você afirmou ser a estrela e dramaturgo, ativando a maldição daquelas páginas. Uma pequena parte da sua pele começou a se transformar em pele de morto-vivo, e a única cura é provar que se tornou altruísta. |
| 3   | **Fama e Fortuna:** Você pensava que era famoso—até aquele herói vir à sua apresentação. De repente, todos os olhos se voltaram para o bruto matador de dragões e não para o palco, onde deveriam. A platéia até o aplaudiu em pé quando ele entrou. Tudo o que você recebeu foram aplausos educados. Tá bom, se as pessoas querem tanto um herói, então você será herói.                                                                |
| 4   | **Músicas dos Mortos:** Suas apresentações sempre tiveram um tom melancólico. durante uma apresentação particularmente emotiva, espíritos perturbaram as pessoas vivas da audiência e sentaram em suas cadeiras. Eles imploraram que prevenisse seu fim, sem dar mais detalhes antes de desaparecer. Você partiu para determinar como ajudar seus fãs mais dedicados.                                                                    |
| 5   | **Sem Voz:** As zombarias de um provocador deixaram você sem palavras durante uma apresentação, ferindo seu orgulho e mexendo com sua arrogância. O incidente afetou sua lendária voz, e só podia falar em sussurros. O provocador era um trapaceiro feérico que roubou sua voz, prometendo devolvê-la depois que fizer o bem pelo mundo.                                                                                                |
| 6   | **Lição Trágica:** Quando um produtor que prejudicou você gritou para que parasse um ladrão que o havia roubado, seu rancor contra ele fez com que deixasse o ladrão fugir. Porém, essa decisão tornou-se trágica quando o ladrão atacou alguém que você amava. Daquele momento em diante, você se responsabiliza em proteger os outros.                                                                                                 |

#### Político

Você trabalhava como líder de uma organização burocrática formal ou governo. Você pode ter sido nomeado, nascido ou eleito para essa posição, mas fazer as pessoas concordarem e tomar decisões pelas pessoas que serve (ou que o servem) era seu ofício. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Quem você representava ou governava?
- Qual era seu cargo e como o conquistou?
- Quem era seu maior rival político?
- De qual segredo capaz de destruir todo o sistema do qual fazia parte você tinha conhecimento?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

**Perícias:** Duas perícias do grupo interpessoal. (Criação Rápida: Liderar, Mentir.)

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Imunidade Diplomática:** Seu poder político permitia que agisse como quisesse sem consequências. Por negligência ou em uma aposta, você acidentalmente machucou ou matou uma pessoa inocente. Por sua posição como oficial, nada aconteceu. Porém, esse evento foi a última gota para a pessoa que mais amava ou respeitava, e ela te abandonou. Você abandonou o mundo de maquinações políticas para recuperar sua confiança. |
| 2   | **Insurrecionista:** Você secretamente fundou uma organização rebelde com a intenção de derrubar o sistema corrupto. Alguém descobriu sua traição, e você foi forçado a fugir ou arriscar ser executado. Você se tornou herói para viver e lutar outro dia em nome dos que não tem poder.                                                                                                                                        |
| 3   | **Conselheiro Respeitado:** Você era senescal de um líder, capaz de influenciar suas opiniões. Porém, fofocas convenceram o líder de que você estava armando um golpe, e foi expulso de seu círculo de influência. Se tornou herói para continuar mudando o mundo significativamente.                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | **Lado Certo da História:** Você tentou trabalhar em mudar as políticas de dentro de uma organização burocrática. Haviam outros como você que eram mais vocais. Você começou a perceber que esses colegas desapareciam da noite para o dia. Não querendo descobrir se era o próximo da lista, você partiu para mudar as coisas mais diretamente.                                                                                 |
| 5   | **Interesseiro:** Você usava sua habilidades para coletar informações escandalosas ou incriminantes de oponentes para chantageá-los. Um rival estava um passo a frente e roubou seu livro de segredos. Porém, em vez de usá-lo contra você, deixaram que você abandonasse o mundo da política. Salvo da humilhação pública, você agora usa suas habilidades para o bem de todos.                                                 |
| 6   | **Livre:** A burocracia necessária para fazer qualquer coisa através do seu cargo político causou uma falha durante uma crise, e muitas pessoas se machucaram ou morreram. Após esse evento lamentável, você resolveu viver livre das interferências burocráticas, procurando fazer o bem com suas ações, não com papeladas.                                                                                                     |

| 1   | **Ideias Literárias:** Você sempre esteve satisfeito em viver uma vida pacata na sua biblioteca, até encontrar aquele livro—o que contava as histórias de heróis que salvavam a timescape. Eles não passavam os dias atrás de uma mesa. Eles faziam a diferença de verdade. Chegou a hora de fazer o mesmo.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | **Curar a Maldição:** Você acreditava que conhecimento poderia resolver tudo. Você estava errado. Quando alguém que amava foi amaldiçoado, a forma de salvá-lo não estava em nenhum de seus livros. Mas não é isso que vai te parar. As respostas estão lá fora, e você vai encontrá-las mesmo que precise enfrentar a morte.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3   | **Biblioteca Perdida:** Um mago maligno roubou todos os seus livros, gargalhando da sua impotência enquanto saqueava suas prateleiras. Agora, você partiu para procurar por ruínas antigas e bibliotecas secretas para reconstruir sua coleção de livros raros e encontrar o mago que te roubou.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4   | **Culpa de Papel:** Enquanto transcrevia textos antigos, você e outro escriba descobriram uma prateleira de livros esquecidos. Por sua sugestão, seu companheiro começou a trabalhar em um deles e sumiu, junto com o livro. Sua culpa o motivou a procurar o amigo desaparecido e prevenir que outras pessoas enfrentem perigos similares.                                                                                                                                    |
| 5   | **Futuro Imprevisto:** Em sua busca por conhecimento antigo, você descobriu uma profecia que ainda não se realizou. E essa profecia envolve uma pessoa que pode ser... você. Desde essa descoberta, você é atormentado por sonhos estranhos, te motivando a buscar seu destino.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | **Desaparecimento:** Inicialmente você pensou que era sua imaginação, e você ignorou o desaparecimento de frases aleatórias em livros históricos. Mas quando os livros começaram a mudar com páginas inteiras em branco, os desaparecimentos foram mais difíceis de ignorar, especialmente os que envolviam textos críticos ou antigos. Motivado pelo desejo de preservar o conhecimento, você se propôs a restaurar e reverter esses textos antes que desapareçam pra frente. |

#### Marujo

Você trabalhava em um navio, como uma nau mercante, embarcação mercenária ou militar, ou barco pirata. Você pode ter trabalhado no convés, sido imediato ou mesmo capitão. Ao definir sua carreira, pense sobre as seguintes perguntas:

- Qual o nome da embarcação em que viajava e qual a atividade que da tripulação?
- Qual era sua função no navio?
- Qual o maior período de tempo que passou embarcado?
- Quem ou o que perdeu em suas jornadas?

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Sozinho:** Você e seu melhor amigo, irmão ou outro ente querido se juntaram para realizar o sonho de viajarem pelo alto-mar. Quando eles morreram, você perdeu o gosto pela vida de navegante. Você partiu na primeira oportunidade e não olhou pra trás.                                                                                                                        |
| 2   | **Desertor:** Durante um ataque de piratas(independente de qual lado você estava) você percebeu que não gostava mais da vida de marujo. Você usou o caos da situação para escapar desapercebido. Você agora trabalha como herói para acabar com a pirataria ou se redimir do seu passado, mas você teme o dia em que sua antiga tripulação encontrar você e puni-lo pela deserção. |
| 3   | **Esquecido:** Você acordou a bordo de seu navio sem nenhuma memória de quem era. Ainda que os outros marujos insistissem que sabem quem você é, você não os conhece. Na próxima vez em que desembarcou, você decidiu ficar, determinado a descobrir quem você realmente é.                                                                                                        |
| 4   | **Inveja:** Você era favorecido pelo seu capitão, o que lhe proporcionou muitas rivalidades a bordo. Uma noite, seus companheiros puxaram você do beliche e jogaram você na água. Por milagre, você foi resgatado por uma embarcação que passava. Você pagou sua dívida com eles trabalhando, então partiu buscando uma nova vida envolvendo menos mesquinharia.                   |
| 5   | **Ilhado:** Houve um motim, e você estava entre os perdedores. Você foi ilhado e escapou quando uma embarcação mercante foi desviada de curso por uma tempestade e encontrou você. Sua reputação foi arruinada entre marujos, então procura aventura de outras formas.                                                                                                             |
| 6   | **Medo D'Água:** Uma tempestade catastrófica em alto mar atingiu seu navio e o destruiu. Você foi o único sobrevivente. Quando se recuperou, você tentou ser contratado por outro navio, mas só pensar no mar aberto amoleceu suas pernas. Em vez disso, decidiu ser um herói viajante para pagar as contas.                                                                       |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Dispensa Desonrosa:** Você se alistou no exército para proteger as pessoas, mas seu comandante ordenou que batesse e matasse civis. Quando recusou, as coisas ficaram violentas. Você escapou por pouco da briga que começou, e agora se compromete a ajudar as pessoas do seu jeito.                                                                                                        |
| 2   | **Desaposentado:** Você teve uma longa e célebre carreira como soldado antes de se aposentar para viver uma vida mais simples. Porém, quando retornou para sua antiga casa, descobriu que seus inimigos tinham a destruído. Agora as habilidades que obteve nos campos de batalha auxiliam a se tornar um outro tipo de guerreiro, que busca salvar outras pessoas do que passou.              |
| 3   | **Paz pela Cura:** Viver em meio a constantes derramamentos de sangue teve seu preço. Você busca a paz por meio da cura e se dedica a terminar guerras antes de começarem, para poupar as pessoas desse horror.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 4   | **Único Sobrevivente:** Você foi o único sobrevivente da sua unidade após uma batalha árdua ou um ataque de monstros, tendo sobrevivido por sorte. Você deixou a vida de soldado pra trás para se tornar um herói que consiga enfrentar tais ameaças.                                                                                                                                          |
| 5   | **Patente Roubada:** Cansado de apenas sobreviver nas ruas, você se alistou no exército. No entanto, não conseguiu escapar o status de classe baixa até o oficial que comandava sua unidade morrer em batalha. No caos que se seguiu, você assumiu a identidade dele, e retornou como herói. Porém quando começaram as suspeitas, você se optou pela vida de aventureiro, sempre em movimento. |
| 6   | **Votos de Sacrifício:** Você prometeu a um soldado aliado que protegeria sua família caso ele morresse em batalha. Quando ele morreu, você viajou até seu vilarejo, mas encontrou sua família morta ou dispersa pelo conflito. Motivado pelo seu juramento, você dedicou sua vida a encontrar sobreviventes e proteger outras pessoas desse destino.                                          |

- Qual ambiente você protegia?
- Você era parte de um grupo oficial de guardiões ou trabalhava sozinho?
- Qual animal se tornou seu companheiro enquanto trabalhava na natureza?
- Qual criatura ou viajante misterioso você encontrou na floresta, e que profecia ele compartilhou com você?

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Traído:** Quando forasteiros chegarem em suas terras com a intenção de explorar os recursos naturais, você se manifestou contra eles. No entanto, vários guardiões falaram em favor dos forasteiros e permitiram que despojassem a natureza. Recusando-se a ver sua terra natal destruída, você partiu. Agora ajuda a evitar que outros locais tenham o mesmo destino. |
| 2   | **Corrupção:** Uma doença infectou as terras que protege, deixando animais violentos e plantas distorcidas de forma sinistra. Você tentou tudo de mágico e mundano para parar a praga, mas ela continua se espalhando. Por isso partiu em busca de uma cura ou de uma nova terra para proteger.                                                                          |
| 3   | **Exilado:** Você cometeu um erro imperdoável. Os outros guardiões da região decidiram sua pena, exilando você da sua terra, ordenado a jamais voltar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4   | **Honrar os Caídos:** Um grupo de heróis chegou em seu território com problemas ao seu encalço. Você lutou com eles para combater esse mal, mas ele os superou. Os heróis morreram e a natureza foi alterada para sempre. Ainda que suas terras não possam ser salvas, há outras que precisam de sua ajuda.                                                              |
| 5   | **Portentos:** Haviam sinais. Você tentou ignorá-los, mas quando uma grande fera morreu aos seus pés, você teve que reconhecer a verdade. Você tinha que deixar sua terra natal, tinha que lutar uma batalha pelo destino de todas as terras—e então abandonou a única vida que conhecia.                                                                                |
| 6   | **Roubo:** Você era responsável por guardar algo precioso e vital para a sobrevivência da sua região. Mas deixou alguém entrar e trair sua confiança, roubando o que deveria guardar. Você partiu para se redimir por seu erro.                                                                                                                                          |

- Qual tipo de policial você era? Você era rígido, tolerante ou corrupto?
- Qual criminoso você nunca capturou?
- A vida de quem salvou no cumprimento do dever?
- Qual foi a chamada mais absurda que já teve que responder e como lidou com ela?

Você ganha os seguintes benefícios de carreira:

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Prioridades:** Você ficou entediado e desiludido de perseguir ladrões e prender pessoas que apenas tentavam sobreviver. Certamente há ameaças maiores no mundo. Você vai encontrar esse mal onde estiver e pará-lo.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | **Corrupção:** Você entrou na polícia para ajudar os necessitados e fazer justiça para os injustiçados. Você não estava preparado para corrupção desenfreada que alcançava o topo da organização. Você se recusou a encobrir seus parceiros e ouviu claramente que deveria deixar a cidade ou arcar com as consequências. Agora você viaja como herói, agindo como o protetor que sempre quis ser.  |
| 3   | **Armação:** Seu parceiro foi assassinado. Isso é incontestável. Mas não foi culpa sua, ao contrário do que as provas indicam. Quando ficou claro que você seria culpado, você fugiu deixando tudo pra trás. Não contente em se esconder nas sombras, você decidiu se aventurar com um novo nome enquanto tenta limpar o antigo.                                                                    |
| 4   | **Mentor Desaparecido:** Você aprendeu tudo o que sabe do seu trabalho de alguém que sempre admirou em uma organização corrupta. Uma noite, você recebeu uma mensagem críptica dessa pessoa dizendo que descobriu "algo importante", mas antes que pudesse descobrir mais, ela desapareceu. Sem saber em quem confiar, você fugiu e buscou uma nova vida. Agora você faz o bem e procura a verdade. |
| 5   | **Fugitivo:** Um criminoso violento ou depravado começou a te perseguir—talvez roubando itens pessoais ou machucando pessoas que você ama—depois de fugir de você. Você abandonou sua carreira para caçar esse criminoso, mas perdeu seus rastros... por enquanto. Pelo menos pode ajudar as pessoas enquanto isso.                                                                                 |
| 6   | **Inimigos Poderosos:** Você se responsabilizou por investigar e destruir a principal organização criminosa da região. Eles enviaram capangas para queimar a sua casa e te dar uma lição; e te deixaram sangrando na rua sem nada, exceto sua vida. Você se tornou herói para ganhar poder e influência para destruir a organização de uma vez por todas.                                           |

# **Classes**

Mesmo que todas as suas decisões na criação de personagem tenham algum peso narrativo, nenhuma influencia tanto a sua maneira de jogar quanto a sua escolha de classe. Sua classe determina como seu herói batalha ameaças à timescape e supera obstáculos. Você domina as forças elementais pela prática de conjuração de feitiços mágicos? Você canaliza a ferocidade do Caos Primordial enquanto cruza o campo de batalha, derrotando inimigos a torto e a direito? Ou você canta baladas heroicas que recuperam seus aliados e os inspiram a feitos cada vez maiores?

Sua classe concede muitos recursos, a maioria das suas habilidades—seus poderes de combate e opções fora dele—e um recurso heroico que alimenta muitas dessas habilidades. Esse livro apresenta 9 classes para você escolher.

**Censuradores**: São guerreiros treinados, devotos a um santo ou deus. Eles caçam as forças do mal usando armas corpo-a-corpo e magia concedida por um patrono divino, especializando-se em confrontar os impuros e controlar um inimigo durante o combate.

**Conduítas**: São padres conjuradores devotos a um santo ou deus. Eles empunham magia divina que castiga inimigos com energia sagrada e apoia seus aliados, e são conhecidos por suas habilidades de cura.

**Elementalistas**: São magos que estudam as forças elementais da timescape—Terra, Verde, Fogo, Vazio, entre outras— e as controlam por meio de magia. Muitas de suas habilidades atingem áreas do campo de batalha, e tem uma gama versátil de truques que permitem que controlem o combate e manipulem o ambiente após a batalha.

**Fúrias**: Transbordando com a ferocidade do Caos Primordial em suas veias, uma Fúria é um guerreiro móvel que se aproxima dos inimigos para causar muito dano. Saltar pelo campo de batalha derrotando inimigos e quebrando paredes é natural para uma Fúria.

**Nulos**: Disciplinados e calmos, os Nulos são guerreiros desarmados que manifestam uma aura que atenua efeitos sobrenaturais e prejudica a força ofensiva de seus inimigos. Eles usam psiônica para deixar seu corpo mais duro que qualquer aço e mais rápido que qualquer montaria.

**Sombras**: Espreitando da escuridão, as Sombras são experts em assassinatos e roubos que lutam tão bem corpo-a-corpo quanto à distância quando surpreendem seus inimigos. Elas utilizam magia para auxiliar com sua mobilidade no campo de batalha e emboscar suas presas.

**Táticos**: Brilhantes estrategistas e especialistas em armas, os Táticos são excepcionais em conceder mais movimentos e ações aos seus aliados em batalha. Eles também apoiam aliados fora de combate, sempre inspirando seus amigos à glória.

**Talentos**: São os mestres psiônicos, manifestando poderes que manipulam objetos, mentes e o tempo. Esses heróis podem se exaurir para usar habilidades mesmo quando não tem os recursos heroicos suficientes—caso aceitem pagar um preço.

**Trovadores**: Inspiram seus aliados com suas histórias e esgrima que são uma arte tanto quando um ato de guerra. Suas piadas, músicas, poemas e contos épicos produzem magia que prejudicam inimigos e fortalecem aliados. Eles podem até usar magia para alterar a história da campanha em tempo real de acordo com seus interesses.

## Subclasses

Cada classe também tem um número de subclasses apresentado nesse livro. Sua subclasse determina várias das suas habilidades e recursos, e define melhor como interage com o mundo a partir do Nível 1. Você escolhe uma subclasse quando cria o personagem.

## Habilidades

Habilidades são ações, manobras, entre outros poderes especiais que permitem que você afete criaturas, objetos e o ambiente. Elas representam as principais atividades que seu personagem pode realizar durante o combate ou outra situação controlada por rondas. Todos os personagens tem acesso a algumas habilidades básicas, incluindo golpes simples e manobras como Agarrar e Empurrão (veja Manobras no Capítulo de Combate). Porém, sua classe, linhagem (veja Capítulo de Linhagens), kit (veja Capítulo de Kits), títulos e tesouros (veja Capítulo de Recompensas), e outras opções heroicas dão acesso a habilidades mais poderosas que fazem com que seu herói se destaque.

Habilidades são apresentadas em um formato especial que primeiro a descreve, resume seus detalhes mecânicos, e por fim mostra seu lançamento de poder (caso ela tenha um) e seus efeitos.

> **Habilidades Durante o Combate**
>
> Todas as habilidades que aparecem nesse livro são usadas como ação principal, manobra, reação ou como outra parte do seu turno. Dessa forma, essas habilidades são todas explicitamente utilizadas em combates ou em outras situações que dependam do tempo, onde o jogo é controlado por rondas. Se uma criatura tem uma habilidade que demora 1 minuto ou mais para usar, essa habilidade não pode ser usada em combate.

### Nome e Texto Narrativo

Cada habilidade tem um nome sugestivo que estabelece o que faz no jogo, seguido por algumas linhas de texto narrativo que dão uma noção de como a habilidade pode ser representada em uma cena de ação da história.

O nome e texto narrativo das habilidades por vezes mencionam formas específicas de usar a habilidade—especialmente habilidades de combate das quais o nome implica táticas ou armamentos específicos. No entanto, o texto narrativo não tem nenhum efeito em como uma habilidade pode ser usada. Por exemplo, a habilidade Empalado das Fúrias permite agarrar um alvo, estabelecendo a idea de arpoar o monstro oponente com uma espada para mantê-lo próximo. Porém, pode usar essa habilidade com um machado, maça, martelo ou qualquer outra arma.

### Custos de Recurso Heroico

Cada classe tem um recurso heroico que seu herói adquire durante o combate, e algumas de suas habilidades de classe—geralmente as mais poderosas—requerem um custo de recurso heroico para usá-las. Quando usa uma dessas habilidades, você gasta o recurso heroico de sua classe, depois ativa a habilidade.

Os nove recursos heroicos no jogo são:

- A Ira dos Censuradores
- A Piedade dos Conduítas
- A Essência dos Elementalistas

#### Habilidades Heroicas

Se uma habilidade tem um custo de recurso heroico para ativar—ou seja, você não pode usar a habilidade sem gastar algum recurso heroico—ela é uma habilidade heroica. Se um efeito permite usar uma habilidade heroica fora do seu turno, você deve pagar o custo de recurso heroico para usá-la, a não ser que o efeito diga o contrário.

Algumas habilidades não custam recurso heroico para usar, mas permitem gastá-lo para aumentar ou adicionar efeitos à habilidade, como a Graça de Cura dos Conduítas. Essas habilidades não são habilidades heroicas a não ser que a versão básica da habilidade não possa ser usada sem gastar recurso heroico.

#### Habilidades Clássicas

Algumas habilidades concedidas pela sua classe, kit e outros recursos do jogo são habilidades clássicas. As regras declaram especificamente quando uma habilidade é clássica. Habilidades clássicas não requerem recurso heroico para ativar, mas podem deixar gastar recursos heroicos para aumentar ou adicionar efeitos.

### Palavras-Chave de Habilidade

Cada habilidade tem uma ou mais palavras-chave que explicam como a habilidade funciona. Palavras-chave aparecem na primeira linha da habilidade, abaixo do texto narrativo, do lado esquerdo, e podem incluir qualquer dos termos dessa seção. (Uma habilidade que não tem palavras-chave é redigida com o sinal “—”.)

#### Área

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Área criam uma área de efeito. Muitas habilidades de área
causam dano a alvos nessa área, mas tais habilidades são tratadas diferentemente de golpes contra alvos específicos. (Veja o aparte Não São Só Golpes!, bem como Golpe e Habilidades de Área abaixo para mais informações)

#### Investida

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Investida podem ser usadas com a ação principal Investir em vez de um golpe simples corpo-a-corpo. (A ação principal Investir é descrita nas Ações Principais no Capítulo de Combate.)

#### Magia

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Magia são usadas por personagens que podem conjurar feitiços, tem recursos mágicos inatos ou empunham tesouros e itens mágicos. Tais habilidades fazem coisas mágicas como criar raios de fogo, abrir portais ou invocar criaturas.

#### Corpo-a-corpo

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Corpo-a-corpo podem ser usadas apenas em distâncias bem curtas, geralmente dentro do alcance do personagem, por que elas requerem que o personagem faça contato com a criatura ou objeto com seu corpo, arma ou implementos. (Um implemento é um objeto especial usado por personagens que canalizam poder mágico ou psiônico, descritos em Imbuir Tesouros no Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre.)

#### Psiônica

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Psiônica são usadas por personagens que podem manifestar poderes psiônicos, tem recursos psiônicos inatos ou empunham tesouros e itens psiônicos. Tais habilidades podem criar explosões de energia psíquica, mover objetos com telecinese ou desacelerar o tempo com cronopatia.

#### À Distância

Habilidades com a palavra-chave À Distância podem ser usadas para afetar criaturas e objetos que estejam longe demais para fazer contato.

#### Golpe

Habilidades com a palavra-chave Golpe (geralmente referidas apenas como "golpes") causam dano ou impõe efeitos prejudiciais à criaturas ou objetos específicos.

#### Arma

A palavra-chave Arma é usada em habilidades que devem ser usadas com uma lâmina, arco ou outra arma ofensiva. Habilidades de arma também incluem golpes que criaturas fazem com seus corpos, como os golpes desarmados de um personagem ou os socos, chutes, mordidas e batidas de cauda de monstros. O kit do seu personagem determina os tipos de arma que empunha com suas habilidades de arma (veja o Capítulo de Kits).

> **Não São Só Golpes!**
>
> A palavra-chave Golpe e frases como "dá um golpe" são reservadas para habilidades nas quais uma criatura tem como alvos criaturas e objetos específicos (não afetando criaturas ou objetos em uma área) e afeta esses alvos de alguma forma fazendo um lançamento de poder. As várias habilidades do jogo que atingem áreas de efeito não são golpes. Elas usam a palavra-chave Área. Isso significa que se um efeito distingue que interage com um golpe, esse efeito não se aplica a habilidades com a palavra-chave Área.

### Tipo

Cada habilidade descreve o tipo de atividade requerida para utilizá-la ao lado direito, na primeira linha abaixo do texto narrativo. A maioria das habilidades exigem que use uma ação principal, manobra, ação de movimento, reação, manobra livre ou reação livre (todos esses termos são explicados em Agindo no seu Turno no Capítulo de Combate). Por exemplo, se você usa uma habilidade com o tipo “Ação Principal”, deve gastar sua ação principal para ativar a habilidade.

#### Gatilho

Se uma habilidade requer uma reação ou reação livre para ser usada, um “Gatilho” será descrito na habilidade. Por exemplo, o gatilho da habilidade Aparar do Tático é: “Uma criatura causa dano ao alvo.” Um Tático pode usar a habilidade Aparar apenas quando esse gatilho específico ocorrer.

### Distância

A “Distância” de uma habilidade, representada pelo símbolo 📏, indica o quão perto você precisa estar da criatura ou objeto alvo para afetá-lo com a habilidade.

#### Corpo-a-corpo

Habilidades corpo-a-corpo tem a distância “Corpo-a-corpo X” e requerem que faça contato com o alvo com seu corpo, arma ou implemento. O número X é a distância máxima em quadrados na qual você pode fisicamente fazer contato com outra criatura ou objeto alvos da habilidade. Por exemplo, uma distância de “Corpo-a-corpo 2” pode ser usada em criaturas ou objetos alvos dentro de 2 quadrados de distância de você, enquanto “Corpo-a-corpo 1” limita você a alvos adjacentes (dentro de 1 quadrado de distância).

#### À Distância

Habilidades à distância tem a distância “À Distância X” e podem ser usadas em criaturas e objetos alvos que estejam distantes demais para se fazer contato. O número X é a distância máxima em quadrados na qual uma criatura ou objeto pode ser alvo da habilidade. Por exemplo, uma habilidade com distância de “À Distância 5” pode ter como alvos criaturas ou objetos dentro de 5 quadrados de distância de você.

Se você dá um golpe à distância enquanto qualquer inimigo esteja adjacente a você (dentro de 1 quadrado de distância), você recebe desvantagem no lançamento de poder. (Veja Vantagens e Desvantagens no Capítulo O Básico.)

#### Corpo-a-corpo ou À Distância

Algumas habilidades tem uma distância Corpo-a-corpo e uma distância À Distância. Quando usa uma dessas habilidades, você escolhe se vai usá-la corpo-a-corpo ou à distância.

Uma habilidade nunca tem ambas as palavras-chaves Corpo-a-corpo e À Distância ao mesmo tempo. Por exemplo, se você tem o kit de Capa e Adaga, que concede um bônus de dano de armas para habilidades corpo-a-corpo e um bônus de dano de armas para habilidades à distância, apenas um bônus por vez se aplica a uma habilidade com ambas as palavras-chaves corpo-a-corpo e à distância. (Veja Capítulo de Kits.)

#### Personagem

Se uma habilidade tem a distância “Personagem,” essa habilidade se origina de você, e só afeta você. A descrição da habilidade descreve como ela funciona.

### Habilidades em Área

Habilidades em área cobrem um número de quadrados do campo de batalha ao mesmo tempo, criando um efeito dentro dessa área que afeta múltiplas criaturas ou objetos. Quando uma habilidade cria uma área de efeito, ela às vezes denota uma distância para o efeito no formato "dentro de X". O número X significa quantos quadrados de distância essa área pode estar de você. Se uma habilidade em área não tem distância, ela se origina de você e você está no centro da área.

Se uma habilidade em área se origina a uma distância de você, então um quadrado da área de efeito deve estar dentro dessa distância, e também deve estar dentro da sua linha de efeito (veja abaixo). Esse quadrado é chamado de **quadrado de origem** da área de efeito. A área de efeito pode se espalhar a partir do quadrado de origem como você quiser, seguindo as regras para o formato e disposição da área especificada.

Você pode colocar uma área de efeito que inclua um ou mais quadrados fora da sua linha de efeito, desde que tenha linha de efeito para o quadrado de origem. A não ser que determine o contrário, habilidades em área não passam por barreiras sólidas como paredes e tetos, e não se espalham por cantos.

Uma habilidade de área pode usar qualquer uma das áreas de efeito seguintes:

#### Aura

Quando uma habilidade cria uma aura, essa área é expressa como “X Aura.” O número X é o raio da aura, que sempre se origina de você e se move com você durante a duração da habilidade que a criou. Uma criatura ou objeto deve estar dentro de X quadrados de distância para ser alvo de uma habilidade de aura.

#### Explosão

Quando uma habilidade cria uma explosão, essa área é expressa como “X Explosão.” O número X é o raio da explosão, que sempre se origina de você e dura apenas o suficiente para afetar seus alvos. Uma criatura ou objeto deve estar dentro de X quadrados de distância para ser alvo de uma habilidade de explosão.

#### Cubo

Quando uma habilidade cria um cubo, essa área é expressa como “X Cubo.” O número X é o comprimento de cada lado da área. Uma criatura ou objeto deve estar dentro da área para ser alvo de uma habilidade de cubo.

#### Linha

Quando uma habilidade cria uma linha, essa área é expressa como “A × B Linha.” O número A denota o comprimento da linha em quadrados, enquanto o número B é igual a largura e altura da linha em quadrados. Quando uma área de efeito em linha é criada, os quadrados dessa área devem ser em linha reta. Uma criatura ou objeto deve estar dentro da área para ser alvo de uma habilidade de linha.

#### Parede

Quando uma habilidade cria uma parede, essa área é expressa como “X Parede.” O número X é quantos quadrados são usados para fazer a parede. Quando cria uma parede, pode colocar um quadrado de cada vez, mas cada quadrado deve compartilhar ao menos um lado (não apenas um vértice) com outro quadrado da parede. Uma criatura ou objeto deve estar dentro da área para ser alvo de uma habilidade de parede.

Você pode colocar quadrados uns sobre os outros para deixar um parede mais alta. A não ser que determine o contrário, uma parede não pode ser colocada em quadrados ocupados e bloqueia linha de efeito.

> **Linhas Retas**
>
> Quando mencionamos uma área de efeito em linha reta em um mapa de encontro, não queremos dizer que a linha só pode ser uma linha reta vertical ou horizontal de quadrados contíguos. "**Linha reta**" significa que cada quadrado no comprimento dessa linha deve movê-la na mesma direção, sem dobrar de volta na direção contrária. Para fazer uma área em linha rapidamente, escolha o quadrado de origem da sua linha, então escolha cada quadrado na linha, um de cada vez, na mesma direção sem dobrar de volta na direção contrária.
>
> Da mesma forma, habilidades e efeitos que requerem que uma criatura se mova em linha reta, como a ação principal Investir ou movimentos forçados que sejam de puxar ou empurrar, não precisam formar uma linha reta de quadrados na grade. Apenas mova a criatura um quadrado por vez em uma mesma direção sem dobrar de volta na direção contrária à que já a moveu.

### Alvo

O “Alvo” de uma habilidade, representado pelo símbolo 🎯, indica o número de criaturas, objetos ou ambos que podem ser alvos dessa habilidade. Você sempre pode afetar menos alvos do que o número indicado.

#### Criatura

Se uma habilidade tem como alvos uma ou mais criaturas, ela pode afetar criaturas dentro de sua distância ou área. Você não é uma criatura elegível como alvo de suas próprias habilidades, a não ser que essas habilidades também tenham “Personagem ” como alvo (veja abaixo), ou que a habilidade determine o contrário.

#### Objeto

Se uma habilidade tem como alvos um ou mais objetos, ela pode afetar qualquer objeto dentro de sua distância ou área. A não ser que determine o contrário, objetos tem imunidade total a veneno e imunidade total a psíquico. (Dano no Capítulo de Combate tem informações sobre imunidade a dano.)

Quando uma habilidade pode afetar criaturas e objetos, a habilidade pode causar dano a objetos. No entanto, a não ser que determinem o contrário (como na habilidade Telecinese Inferior dos Talentos) ou caso o Diretor permita, objetos são imunes aos demais efeitos de uma habilidade. Se uma habilidade força um objeto a fazer um teste, o objeto automaticamente obtém Grau 1 no teste.

#### Inimigo

Se uma habilidade tem como alvos um ou mais inimigos, só pode afetar criaturas que sejam hostis à criatura usando a habilidade. Geralmente, você decide quem conta como inimigo para o propósito de usar as habilidades do seu Herói, no entanto, o Diretor tem a palavra final.

#### Aliado

Se uma habilidade tem como alvos um ou mais aliados, só pode afetar criaturas dispostas que sejam amigáveis à criatura usando a habilidade. Geralmente, você e qualquer outro jogador do qual um personagem seja alvo de habilidade sua decidem quem conta como aliado, no entanto, o Diretor tem a palavra final.

Você não é um alvo elegível para suas próprias habilidades que tem aliados como alvos, a não ser que essas habilidades também tenham “Personagem ” como alvo (veja abaixo), ou que a habilidade determine o contrário.

#### Personagem

Se uma habilidade tem como alvo “Personagem,” ela pode afetar apenas a criatura usando essa habilidade. Suas próprias habilidades só podem te afetar se tem como alvo “Personagem.”

#### Cada Alvo

Se uma habilidade em área não limita um número de alvos, mas em vez disso diz que se aplica a cada criatura, objeto, inimigo ou aliado em uma área, então todos os alvos elegíveis para a habilidade são afetados.

> **Distinguir Amigos de Inimigos**
>
> Podem haver situações nas quais um adversário se disfarça ou se esconde para que temporariamente seja considerado um aliado—ou pelo menos não seja considerado inimigo. Até o fim desse efeito, tal criatura não pode ser alvo de habilidades que normalmente tem inimigos como alvos. Ainda assim, não se preocupe. Todas as classes tem acesso a pelo menos uma habilidade que afeta criaturas, sejam amigas ou inimigas.

### Lançamento de Habilidade

Se uma habilidade requer um lançamento de poder, ela denota em “Lançamento de Poder” qual característica adicionar ao lançamento de 2d10 que você faz quando usa a habilidade. (Capítulo O Básico trata dos lançamentos de poder.)

Ao contrário dos lançamentos de poder feitos para testes (veja Capítulo de Testes), lançamentos de habilidade sempre causam algo útil. Você faz o lançamento para determinar o impacto da habilidade, incluindo o quanto de dano ela causa e qualquer outro efeito que ela impõe, baseado no Grau obtido no lançamento de poder. Por example, a habilidade Impacto Brutal das Fúrias é um golpe corpo-a-corpo que tem como alvo uma criatura adjacente (dentro de 1 quadrado de distância), e que tem os seguintes efeitos:

- Grau 1 (11 ou menos): A habilidade causa dano igual a 3 + seu valor de Músculo, então empurra o alvo pra trás 1 quadrado.
- Grau 2 (12 – 16): A habilidade causa dano igual a 6 + seu valor de Músculo, então empurra o alvo pra trás 2 quadrados.
- Grau 3 (17 ou mais): A habilidade causa dano igual a 9 + seu valor de Músculo, então empurra o alvo pra trás 4 quadrados.

#### Características e Dano

Algumas habilidades causadoras de dano expressam seu dano como um número seguido de um sinal de adição (+) e da letra M , A , R , I ou P. A letra indicada significa que você some o seu valor de característica—seja Músculo, Agilidade, Razão, Intuição ou Presença—ao dano causado pela habilidade. Algumas habilidades permitem usar o seu maior valor de característica para o lançamento de poder.

Usando a habilidade Impacto Brutal das Fúrias como exemplo de novo, a habilidade usa um lançamento de poder de Músculo e contém as seguintes expressões de dano nos três Graus do lançamento de poder:

- **≤11:** 3 + M de dano
- **12-16:** 6 + M de dano
- **17+:** 9 + M de dano

Para uma Fúria com 2 de Músculo, o dano causado pela habilidade seria:

- **≤11:** 5 de dano
- **12-16:** 8 de dano
- **17+:** 11 de dano

O dano dessas habilidades aumenta a cada Escalão de jogo, já que seu valor de característica melhora sempre que você alcança um novo escalão.

Algumas habilidades, incluindo seus golpes simples, permitem que você escolha qual valor de característica adicionar ao seu dano. Tais habilidades usam um formato similar a "7 + M ou A de dano", indicando que você pode adicionar seu Músculo ou sua Agilidade para determinar o dano. (Capítulo de Combate tem mais informações sobre dano.)

#### Habilidades com Dano e Efeitos

Golpes e habilidades em área podem causar dano e ter um efeito adicional em seu alvo. O dano e a força do efeito são determinados pelo lançamento de habilidade.

Para manter o jogo fluindo rapidamente e facilitar a leitura das habilidades durante o jogo, o dano e os efeitos são separados com um ponto e vírgula (;) nos Graus de lançamentos de poder, com os efeitos abreviados sempre que possível. Um efeito determinado por um lançamento de poder sempre se aplica ao alvo, a não ser que determine o contrário. Por exemplo, a habilidade Impacto Brutal mencionada acima tem o seguinte formato de lançamento de poder:

**Lançamento de Poder + Músculo:**

- **≤11:** 3 + M de dano; empurrar 1
- **12-16:** 6 + M de dano; empurrar 2
- **17+:** 9 + M de dano; empurrar 4

A não ser que se indique o contrário, quaisquer efeitos que são determinados pelo Grau de um lançamento de poder ocorrem após o dano do lançamento de poder ser causado a todos os alvos. Se um lançamento de habilidade causa dano a múltiplos alvos mas seus efeitos se aplicam à criatura usando a habilidade ou ao Diretor, como Devaneio de Fogo dos Elementalistas, então o efeito ocorre só uma vez, não uma vez por alvo. Se Graus diferentes afetarem múltiplos alvos, a criatura usando a habilidade escolhe o efeito de qual Grau lançado se aplica a ela ou ao Diretor. Se uma habilidade cria múltiplos efeitos, esses efeitos se resolvem na ordem pela qual são apresentados.

### “Durante o Movimento”

Certos efeitos de habilidade permitem que se mova e afete outras criaturas ou objetos durante esse movimento, como a habilidade Cem Gargantas das Sombras. Para tais habilidades, o movimento começa no espaço que você deixa inicialmente quando começa a se mover e termina no último espaço para qual se mover.

### Dano Lançado

Certos efeitos falam sobre dano lançado, que se refere ao dano variável determinado fazendo um lançamento de habilidade. Se uma habilidade ou efeito causa dano sem requerer um lançamento de poder, isso não é dano lançado e efeitos que aumentam ou são causados por dano lançado não se aplicam.

### Potências

Muitas habilidades e outros efeitos impõe condições e estados nos alvos. Porém, criaturas por vezes recebem uma oportunidade de resistir tais efeitos. Afinal, um monstro com bastante Músculo deve ser mais difícil de derrubar do que uma criatura com um valor baixo dessa característica, na maioria das vezes.

Efeitos de habilidade que tem uma **potência** são aplicados a um alvo apenas se o valor da potência desse efeito é maior que o valor de característica indicado do alvo. A característica que o alvo usa para resistir uma potência é baseada na habilidade usada, enquanto o valor da potência para as habilidades do seu herói é baseada em uma de suas características, determinada pela sua classe.

Seu personagem tem valores de potência **fraca**, **média** e **forte**, assim definidos:

- Seu valor de potência fraca é igual a seu maior valor de característica − 2.
- Seu valor de potência média é igual a seu maior valor de característica − 1.
- Seu valor de potência forte é igual a seu maior valor de característica.

Em habilidades e outros efeitos, uma potência sempre aparece como uma abreviatura de uma letra da característica do alvo: M para Músculo, A para Agilidade, R para Razão, I para Intuição ou P para Presença. Essa característica é seguida pelo sinal “menor que” (<) e seu valor de potência—por exemplo, M < FRACA ou R < MÉDIA— com o valor indicando o valor mínimo naquela característica que o alvo precisa para resistir ao efeito.

Como um exemplo, considere a habilidade Martelo do Julgamento dos Conduítas, que tem o seguinte lançamento de poder:

**Lançamento de Poder + Intuição:**

- **≤11:** 3 + I de dano sagrado; A < FRACA, derrubado
- **12-16:** 6 + I de dano sagrado; A < MÉDIA, derrubado
- **17+:** 9 + I de dano sagrado; A < FORTE, derrubado e não pode levantar (até resistir)

No Nível 1, um Conduíta usa seu valor de Intuição para determinar seus valores de potência, e esse valor é 2. Isso concede ao Conduíta as seguintes potências:

- Fraca: 0
- Média: 1
- Forte: 2

Quando registra Martelo do Julgamento em sua ficha de personagem, o jogador do Conduíta atualiza o dano e converte as potências fraca, média, e forte aos seus valores numéricos, sabendo que esses valores não vão mudar até o personagem chegar no 2º escalão e seu valor de Intuição se tornar 3. Isso produz o seguinte:

**Lançamento de Poder + Intuição:**

- **≤11:** 5 de dano sagrado; A < 0, derrubado
- **12-16:** 8 de dano sagrado; A < 1, derrubado
- **17+:** 11 de dano sagrado; A < 2, derrubado e não pode levantar (até resistir)

Durante uma sessão de jogo, o Conduíta usa Martelo do Julgamento contra um bandido com valor de Agilidade de 0. A habilidade portanto tem os seguintes resultados em cada Grau:

- Com um Grau 1 (11 ou menos), a habilidade causa 5 de dano sagrado ao bandido. Mas o bandido resiste o efeito adicional por que sua Agilidade é 0 (e portanto, não tem uma Agilidade menor que 0).
- Com um Grau 2 (12–16), a habilidade causa 5 de dano sagrado. E o bandido também é derrubado, incapaz de resistir ao efeito adicional por que precisaria de 1 ou mais de Agilidade para resistir. Se o bandido tivesse Agilidade 1 ou mais, ele teria sofrido 8 de dano sagrado mas seguido em pé.
- Com um Grau 3 (17 ou mais), o bandido sofre 11 de dano sagrado e é derrubado sem conseguir se levantar, incapaz de resistir a potência forte do efeito adicional com apenas 0 de Agilidade.

#### Apresentação de Potência

Potências são apresentadas de forma abreviada nas habilidades para que não ocupem muito espaço, e para que você possa lê-las assim: "Se a [característica] do alvo for menos que [valor da potência], ele [sofre efeito]." Se nosso Conduíta Nível 1 obtivesse um Grau 2 usando Martelo do Julgamento, o jogador diria, “Eu causo 8 de dano sagrado, e se a Agilidade do bandido é menor que 1, ele é derrubado.”

Ler a habilidade assim reduz as perguntas e respostas. Você não precisa perguntar "qual a Agilidade do alvo?", esperar a resposta, e só então falar o resultado. Você pode só dizer "Se a Agilidade dele não é 1 ou mais, ele é derrubado." Jogadores podem deixar o Diretor verificar se o alvo é derrubado e dar sequência ao jogo, com o Diretor fazendo o mesmo quando os monstros e outros oponentes usam habilidades com potências contra os heróis.

#### Alterando Potências

Potências foram criadas para resolução rápida durante o jogo, mas algumas reações e outras habilidades—por exemplo, as habilidades Julgamento dos Censuradores e Campo Nulo dos Nulos—permitem que você manipule o valor de potências. Se você criou um herói que pode ajustar potências, preste atenção durante o combate! Você pode ser capaz de auxiliar um amigo que precisa de uma ajudinha pra que sua habilidade tenha efeito completo, ou impedir um inimigo que esteja prestes a controlar um dos seus aliados.

#### Gastando Recursos em Potências

Se uma habilidade ou recurso permite a você gastar seu recurso heroico em um efeito que é inteiramente dependente em uma potência e o alvo não é afetado por que sua característica é alta o suficiente para resistir a potência, você não gasta seu recurso heroico.

Por exemplo, a habilidade Cobertura dos Táticos permite a eles gastar 1 Foco para impor a condição lento em um alvo que tem R < MÉDIA. Já que gastar Foco dessa forma não tem outros efeitos, se o Tático tem como alvo uma criatura com alta Razão de forma que ela não seja afetada, o Tático não desperdiça Foco. No entanto, se gastar esse Foco tivesse outro efeito automático como causar dano adicional ao alvo, o 1 Foco seria gasto ainda que a potência seja resistida.

Essa regra também se aplica a criaturas controladas pelo Diretor que gastam Malícia em habilidades e recursos que afetam alvos usando potência e não tem outros efeitos automáticos.

### Crítico

Quando você faz um lançamento de habilidade como uma ação principal e lança 19 ou 20 natural—um total de 19 ou 20 antes de adicionar sua característica ou quaisquer outros modificadores—você obtém um crítico. Um crítico permite a você imediatamente fazer uma ação principal adicional depois de resolver o lançamento de poder, independente de ser seu turno e mesmo que esteja Atordoado (veja Condições abaixo).

Você não pode obter um crítico com um lançamento de habilidade feito como uma manobra ou qualquer outro tipo de ação, mas pode obter um crítico com uma ação principal usada fora de seu turno. Por exemplo, um ataque de oportunidade feito como uma reação ou uma habilidade clássica usada como uma reação livre com a ajuda da habilidade Ataque Agora! de um Tático podem ser críticos.

### Lançamentos Contra Múltiplas Criaturas

Quando uma habilidade tem múltiplos alvos (seja um golpe com mais de um alvo ou uma área de efeito), você faz um lançamento de poder e aplica a todos os alvos. Se você tem vantagens ou desvantagens (veja Capítulo O Básico) contra apenas alguns dos alvos, você pode aplicar diferentes Graus para alvos diferentes.

Por exemplo, se você tem três criaturas como alvo de uma habilidade de golpe e o total do lançamento de poder é 11, cada alvo deve ser afetado pelo Grau 1 da habilidade. No entanto, se você tem vantagem em golpes contra um dos alvos, adicionando 2 ao lançamento de poder, seu total contra aquele alvo é 13, e eles são afetados pelo Grau 2 da habilidade.

### Impulsos

Uma canção de batalha de um Trovador, a Ferocidade crescente de uma Fúria e o Discernimento paciente de uma Sombra podem todos fazerem heróis mais eficazes em combate. Essa maior eficácia é representada por impulsos, com muitas habilidades concedendo impulsos em batalha.

Quando ganha impulsos, você os marca em sua ficha de personagem. Impulsos podem ser usados durante o combate para causar dano adicional aos seus inimigos e aumentar o valor das suas potências, da seguinte forma:

- Quando causa dano lançado, pode gastar até 3 impulsos para causar dano adicional a uma criatura ou objeto alvo da habilidade. Cada impulso que gastar causa dano adicional igual a seu maior valor de característica.

- Quando usa uma habilidade com potência tendo como alvo uma ou mais criaturas, pode gastar 2 impulsos para aumentar a potência para um alvo em 1. Você não pode aumentar a potência mais do que 1 usando impulsos, mas pode gastar impulsos adicionais para aumentar a potência para múltiplos alvos em 1.

Você perde impulsos quando os gasta. No fim do combate, você perde todos os impulsos que ainda tiver.

### Efeito

Muitas habilidades que exigem lançamentos de poder também descrevem efeitos adicionais ou regras para o uso da habilidade separadamente. Se uma habilidade não exige um lançamento de poder, ela descreve como funciona em seus efeitos.

#### Ações Durante Ações

Se o efeito de uma habilidade permite que você faça uma ação principal, manobra, ação de movimento ou reação, o custo de fazê-lo está incluso no tipo da habilidade, expresso na primeira linha abaixo do texto narrativo. Você nunca precisa gastar tempo adicional para usar uma habilidade. Por exemplo, a habilidade Teletransporte de Cinza Negra é uma manobra que permite às Sombras teleportarem-se e então usarem a manobra Esconder-se como seu efeito. Usar a manobra Esconder-se é parte da manobra usada pela habilidade, então você não precisa ter outra manobra disponível para usá-la.

### Gastar Recursos Heroicos

Algumas habilidades dizem “Gaste X [Recurso Heroico]” no corpo da habilidade. Isso concede efeitos adicionais a uma habilidade, onde X é a quantidade de recurso heroico que precisa gastar para ativar esses efeitos adicionais. Se na habilidade lê-se “Gaste X+ [Recurso Heroico],” você pode gastar o quanto quiser do seu recurso heroico disponível em múltiplos de X para aumentar o impacto desse efeito, conforme descrito na habilidade.

### Acumulando Efeitos Únicos

Os efeitos únicos de habilidades diferentes são combinados—efetivamente se acumulando uns sobre os outros—se suas durações e alvos coincidirem. No entanto, os efeitos da mesma habilidade usada múltiplas vezes não acumulam. Em vez disso, o efeito mais forte—como o de maior bônus—dentre os usos da habilidade é utilizado. O uso mais recente da habilidade é utilizado para determinar sua duração. Por exemplo, a habilidade Campo Nulo dos Nulos reduz as potências dos inimigos dentro do campo por 1. Se dois Nulos aliados tem seus Campos Nulos ativados e um cultista inimigo é afetado por ambos, as potências do cultista são reduzidas por 1, não por 2.

Efeitos diferentes que impõe a mesma condição (veja Condições abaixo) não se acumulam para impor a condição duas vezes. Por exemplo, se um herói é alvo de várias criaturas que tenham habilidades que o deixem enfraquecido (impondo desvantagem no lançamentos de poder do alvo), o alvo não é enfraquecido duas vezes impondo desvantagem dupla nesses lançamentos. Um personagem agarrado por um inimigo não pode ser agarrado de novo por outro inimigo. O mesmo vale para efeitos de jogo que não são condições. Por exemplo, se um herói é alvo de múltiplas habilidades ou efeitos que reduzem seu valor de recuperação pela metade. o valor de recuperação do herói só é reduzido pela metade uma vez.

### Terminando Efeitos

Quando uma criatura sofre um efeito duradouro, a habilidade, recurso, perigo ou outra mecânica que impôs esse efeito especifica a duração do efeito. A não ser que se determine o contrário, todos os efeitos e condições que são impostas em heróis durante um encontro de combate terminam quando o encontro termina, caso o herói deseje, exceto as condições ofegante, inconsciente e morrendo. Depois do combate, efeitos e condições impostas em outras criaturas terminam quando é conveniente para os heróis, permitindo que os personagens facilmente amarrem ou fujam de inimigos inconscientes. No entanto, o Diretor pode decidir que um dragão inconsciente não fica assim por tempo suficiente para ser amarrado.

#### Fim do Próximo Turno (FdT)

Muitos efeitos duram até o fim do próximo turno do alvo, abreviado como “(FdT)” nos Graus do lançamento de poder de uma habilidade. Uma criatura sofre esse efeito até o fim do próximo turno dela, ou até o fim do turno atual dela caso o efeito tenha sido imposto durante o turno atual.

#### Teste de Resistência (Até Resistir)

Se um efeito diz “(Até Resistir)” ao fim de sua descrição, uma criatura sofrendo esse efeito faz um teste de resistência ao fim de cada um dos seus turnos para terminar o efeito. Um teste de resistência representa a pura sorte envolvida em livrar-se de um efeito. Já que um alvo geralmente teve uma oportunidade de evitar um efeito “Até Resistir” usando um valor de característica para resistir uma potência, agora ele depende da sorte.

Para fazer um teste de resistência, a criatura lança um d10. Caso lance 6 ou mais, o
efeito termina; caso contrário, ele continua.

#### Fim do Encontro

Alguns efeitos duram até o fim do encontro. Se tal efeito é usado fora de combate, dura 5 minutos.

#### Criatura Termina Efeito de Habilidade

Uma criatura que impõe um efeito em outra criatura usando uma habilidade pode terminar esse efeito como uma manobra livre a não ser que a habilidade determine o contrário.

### Adjacente

Muitas habilidades e outras opções se referem a criaturas, objetos ou espaços que estão adjacentes a uma criatura específica. Algo está adjacente a uma criatura se estiver dentro de 1 quadrado de distância dessa criatura.

### Linha de Efeito

Você precisa ter linha de efeito até criaturas ou objetos para tê-los como alvo de uma habilidade ou efeito, incluindo dar golpes. Se qualquer objeto sólido, como uma parede or pilar, completamente bloqueia o alvo de você, então você não tem linha de efeito.

Se não sabe ao certo se tem linha de efeito até um alvo, imagine desenhar uma linha reta de qualquer canto do espaço que você ocupa no mapa de encontro até qualquer canto do espaço que o alvo ocupa. Se um ou mais cantos do seu espaço conectam com quaisquer cantos do espaço do alvo sem uma obstrução entre eles, você tem linha de efeito até esse alvo.

À discrição do Diretor, obstruções frágeis ou precárias como uma janela de vidro ou cortinas de linho não bloqueiam linha de efeito, e podem ser automaticamente quebradas ou rasgadas por golpes ou outras habilidades que os atravessem.

Se você usa uma habilidade que cria um efeito ambiental, como um portal, você deve ter linha de efeito até o espaço onde cria o efeito ambiental. Se quer criar uma área de efeito em uma área específica, precisa ter linha de efeito até ao menos um dos quadrados nessa área (veja Habilidades em Área acima)

### Linha Reta

Quando uma criatura se move ou é submetida a movimento forçado—empurrar, puxar ou deslizar (veja Capítulo de Combate)—esse movimento geralmente é em linha reta. Habilidades que permitem que você se mova ou mova forçadamente outra criatura normalmente mencionam mover-se diretamente até ou distanciar-se de uma criatura ou um objeto. Porém, mesmo quando um movimento precisa ser em linha reta, ele não precisa ser uma linha horizontal ou vertical em um mapa de encontro. (veja o aparte Linhas Retas anteriormente nesse Capítulo.)

### Chão e Teto

Algumas habilidades e outros efeitos se referem a heróis ou seus alvos que estão "no chão". A não ser que se determine o contrário, “Chão” significa qualquer superfície na qual uma criatura possa tipicamente ficar em pé, sentar-se ou deitar-se; seja o piso de pedra de um castelo, a terra de uma estrada, o convés de um navio, ou uma plataforma de metal suspensa no ar.

Da mesma forma, se um efeito se refere a “Teto”, isso significa qualquer superfície sólida acima de uma criatura; seja o telhado de madeira de uma taverna, o teto de pedra de uma caverna ou uma parede invisível de força.

### Condições

Algumas habilidades e outros efeitos impõe a uma criatura efeitos negativos específicos chamados de condições. As condições a seguir aparecem frequentemente no jogo e podem ser marcadas na sua ficha de personagem quando afetam seu herói.

#### Sangrando

Enquanto uma criatura está sangrando, sempre que ela usa uma ação principal, reação ou faz teste ou lançamento de habilidade usando Músculo ou Agilidade, ela perde Vigor igual a 1d6 + o Nível dela após a ação principal, reação ou lançamento de poder ser resolvido. Essa perda de Vigor não pode ser prevenida de nenhuma forma.

Você sofre dano dessa condição quando usa uma ação principal fora do seu turno. Por exemplo, uma habilidade clássica usada como reação livre por causa da habilidade Ataque Agora! de um Tático causa o dano da condição "Sangrando".

#### Atordoado

Uma criatura atordoada só pode fazer uma coisa em seu turno: usar uma ação principal, usar uma manobra ou usar uma ação de movimento. Uma criatura atordoada também não pode usar reações, reações livres ou manobras livres.

#### Assustado

Quando uma criatura está assustada, qualquer lançamento de habilidade que fazem contra a origem do seu medo recebe desvantagem. Se a origem é uma criatura, os lançamentos de habilidade feitos por ela contra a criatura assustada ganham vantagem. Uma criatura assustada não pode se mover voluntariamente para perto da origem de seu medo se souberem a localização dessa origem. Se uma criatura ganha a condição "Assustada" de uma origem enquanto já assustada por outra origem, a nova condição substitui a anterior.

#### Agarrado

Uma criatura agarrada tem velocidade 0, não pode ser movida forçadamente exceto pela criatura, objeto ou efeito que a tem agarrada, não pode usar a manobra Empurrão (veja Manobras no Capítulo de Combate), e recebe desvantagem em habilidades que não tem a criatura, objeto ou efeito que a tem agarrada como alvo. Se uma criatura é agarrada por outra criatura e essa criatura se move, ela leva a criatura agarrada consigo. Se o tamanho de uma criatura é menor ou igual ao tamanho da criatura que ela agarrou, sua velocidade é reduzida pela metade enquanto tem essa criatura agarrada.

Uma criatura que tem outra criatura agarrada pode usar uma manobra para mover a criatura agarrada para um espaço desocupado adjacente a ela.

Uma criatura pode soltar uma criatura que tem agarrada a qualquer momento para terminar a condição (nenhuma ação necessária). Uma criatura agarrada pode tentar escapar o agarre usando a manobra Escapar Agarrão(veja Capítulo de Combate). Se uma criatura agarrada teleporta-se, ou se tanto a criatura agarrada quanto a criatura agarrando são movimentadas forçadamente de forma que as criaturas não estejam adjacentes uma a outra, a criatura deixa de estar agarrada.

Uma criatura pode agarrar apenas criaturas do seu tamanho ou menores. Se o valor de Músculo de uma criatura é 2 ou mais, ela pode agarrar qualquer criatura maior que ela com um tamanho igual ou menor ao seu valor de Músculo.

A não ser que se determine o contrário, uma criatura só pode agarrou uma criatura por vez.

#### Derrubado

Enquanto uma criatura está derrubada, ela está deitada no chão, qualquer golpe feito por ela recebe desvantagem, e habilidades corpo-a-corpo usadas contra criatura derrubada ganham vantagem. Uma criatura derrubada precisa rastejar para se mover pelo chão, o que custa 1 quadrado adicional de movimento para cada quadrado rastejado. Uma criatura não pode escalar, pular, nadar ou voar enquanto estiver derrubada. Se ela está escalando, voando ou pulando quando derrubada, ela clarity.

A não ser que a habilidade ou efeito que impôs a Condição "Derrubado" diga o contrário, uma criatura derrubada pode se levantar usando a manobra Levantar (veja Manobras no Capítulo de Combate). Uma criatura adjacente a uma criatura derrubada disposta também pode usar a manobra Levantar para levantá-la.

#### Imobilizado

Uma criatura que está imobilizada tem velocidade 0, não pode usar a manobra Levantar, e não pode ser movimentada forçadamente. Uma criatura imobilizada recebe desvantagem em lançamentos de habilidade e em testes de Músculo e Agilidade, e habilidades usadas contra ela ganham vantagem.

Se uma criatura teleporta-se enquanto imobilizada, a condição termina.

#### Lento

Uma criatura lenta tem velocidade 2 a não ser que sua velocidade já seja menor que 2, e ela não pode Ajustar-se.

#### Provocado

Uma criatura provocada recebe desvantagem dupla em lançamentos de habilidade de qualquer habilidade que não tenha como alvo a criatura que a provocou, desde que tenha linha de efeito para essa criatura. Se uma criatura ganha a condição "Provocado" de uma origem enquanto já provocada por outra origem, a nova condição substitui a anterior.

#### Enfraquecido

Uma criatura enfraquecida recebe desvantagem em lançamentos de poder.

### Habilidades em Tabelas de Classe

Cada classe nesse capítulo inclui uma tabela que mostra a progressão de um herói ao ganhar Níveis nessa classe. Cada uma dessas tabelas tem uma coluna de habilidades e outra coluna que mostra habilidades concedidas pela subclasse do herói, definindo todas as habilidades heroicas que um herói dessa classe tem a cada Nível. Cada habilidade é representada por um número que expressa o custo da habilidade em recursos heroicos.

Por exemplo, um Censurador de Nível 6 tem “Clássica, 3, 5, 7, 9” na coluna de Habilidades, e “5, 9” na coluna de habilidades de Ordem (representando a subclasse do Censurador). Isso significa que um Censurador desse Nível tem uma habilidade clássica e quatro habilidades heroicas custando 3, 5, 7 e 9 de Ira respectivamente, além de duas habilidades heroicas de subclasse adicionais custando 5 e 9 de Ira.

> **Ícones Dourados de Criação Rápida**
>
> Habilidades concedidas por sua classe que são opções de Criação Rápida são indicadas por um ícone dourado à esquerda do seu nome. Procure por esse ícone caso esteja usando as opções de Criação Rápida para criar seu herói.

includes a Poder roll, you make that roll once and apply the same Efeito
to all alvos. A criatura can’t be affected by multiple instances of a
Só Mais uma coisa... Habilidade.

Habilidade and Vertical Puxar that alvo up to 5 squares. If their Estabilidade

Discípulo do Verde Recurso on your Turno.
Additionally, whenever you use your Discípulo do Verde Recurso, you
can select an additional Forma Animal and gain the positive benefits
from both forms. You can choose the Tamanho of either animal, and if both
animal forms grant you the same Benefício, you can choose whichever
you prefer. You gain the highest Velocidade between the dois animal forms
and have all types of Movimento from both forms.

```

```

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less.

Nível), but you can’t combine a tubarão with a urso (5th Nível).

You produce a Fogo that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding
your foes. Whenever you deal Fogo dano to a criatura or objeto, they

objeto, you can use a Reação Livre to alvo it with your Return
to Formlessness Habilidade instead.
Additionally, qualquer inimigo who inicia seu turno Adjacente to you has Fogo
weakness equal to your Razão score até o início do seu próximo turno.
This increases to twice your Razão score if the inimigo is made of or is
wearing mostly metal.

1st-Nível Features

As a 1st-Nível Fúria, you gain the following features.

**Aspecto Primordial**

You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization,
older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage
that revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial
Chaos—and that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a
Aspecto Primordial from the following options, each of which grants you
a Perícia. ( _Quick Build:_ Berserker.)

**Berserker:** You channel your Ferocidade into physical Músculo, acting
as a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have
the Levantar Perícia.
**Arrebatadora:** You channel your Ferocidade into instinct and cunning,
challenging the Ordem of civilization. You have the Esconder-se Perícia.
**Tempestuosa:** You channel your Ferocidade into primordial storms and can
take on the form of an animal or an animal Forma Híbrida. You have
the Rastrear Perícia.

Your Aspecto Primordial is your subclass, and your choice of aspect

**Ferocidade**

Within the heat of battle, your Determinação and anger grow, fueling a
Recurso Heróico called Ferocidade.

```

tracked durante o Combate rounds (as determined by the Diretor), you gain

Additionally, the first time each Combate Ronda that you take dano,
you gain 1 Ferocidade. The first time you become Ofegante or are Morrendo in
an Encontro, you gain 1d3 Ferocidade.
You lose qualquer remaining Ferocidade at the end of the Encontro.

```

```

Ferocidade fora de Combate
Though you can’t gain Ferocidade fora de Combate, you can use your
heroic abilities and effects that cost Ferocidade without spending it.
Whenever you use an Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate that costs
Ferocidade, you can’t use that same Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate
De Novo until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a Descanso.

```

```

When you use an Habilidade fora de Combate that lets you Gastar
unlimited Ferocidade on its Efeito, such as Até o Fim Absoluto, you can
use it as if you had spent an amount of Ferocidade equal to your Victories.

```

```

Ferocidade Crescente
You gain certain benefits durante o Combate based on the amount of Ferocidade
you have (see 1st-Nível Aspect Features for details). These benefits last
until the end of your Turno, even if a Benefício would become unavailable
to you because of the amount of Ferocidade you Gastar during your Turno.

```

```

Some Ferocidade Crescente benefits can be applied only if you are a specific
Nível or higher, with the Nível of those benefits noted in the various
Ferocidade Crescente tables in this section.

Where’s My Manobra?
Since most other classes get a bespoke Manobra, you Músculo
find yourself asking, “Where’s the Especial Manobra for the
Fúria?” The answer is that the Classe doesn’t need its own
Manobra, because most of the time, the fantasy of the Fúria
has them using the Agarrar or Empurrar maneuvers durante o Combate.
They’re really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn’t make
sense to give you another option that you’ll rarely or never use.

**As a Tático, you have abilities that Curar your aliados
and grant them increased dano, Movimento,
and attacks, even as you leave your inimigos
struggling to respond.**

“Your Linha is broken,

Varrox! Your wizard is

**Sir John de Tor**

```

Tático

```

Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Músculo of 2 and a Razão of 2,
and you can choose um of the following arrays for your other charac-
teristic scores:

¥ 2, −1, −1
¥ 1, 1, −1
¥ 1, 0, 0

**Fraca Potência:** Razão − 2

Cultura, Empatizar, Flecharia, Mecânica, Monstros, Procurar, Estratégia,
or the skills of the exploration Perícia group. ( _Quick Build:_ Liderar, Monstros,
Estratégia.)

1st-Nível Features

As a 1st-Nível Tático, you gain the following features.

**Doutrina Tática**

Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle
became ever more complex, military leaders invented Doutrina Tática,
outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed.
Doctrine can be learned at Guerra colleges passing on ancient Militar
traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield.
Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven
tactics, you choose a Doutrina Tática from the following options,
each of which grants you a Perícia. ( _Quick Build:_ Vanguardeiro and the
Intimidar Perícia.)

**Insurgente:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and Morrendo honorably in battle
is your opponent’s job. You’ll do whatever it takes to keep your aliados
alive. You gain a Perícia from the intrigue Perícia group.
**Regente:** You have an encyclopedic Conhecimento of warfare, viewing
the battlefield as a game board and buscando a Vitória by thinking steps
ahead of your opponents. You gain a Perícia from the lore Perícia group.
**Vanguardeiro:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting
you Liderar da Dianteira lines and seek Vitória through sheer force
of will and personality. You gain a Perícia from the interpersonal
Perícia group.

Your Doutrina Tática is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine
determines many of the features you’ll gain as you gain new levels.

**Foco**

The ring of steel panics others but brings Ordem to your mind, granting
you a Recurso Heróico called Foco.

```

Foco durante o Combate
no começo of a Combate Encontro or some other stressful situation
tracked durante o Combate rounds (as determined by the Diretor), you gain
Foco equal to your Victories. no começo of each of your turns during
Combate, you gain 2 Foco.

```

```

Additionally, the first time each Combate Ronda that you or qualquer aliado
damages a criatura Marcado by you (see Marca below), you gain 1 Foco.
The first time in a Combate Ronda that qualquer aliado within 10 squares of you
uses a heroic Habilidade, you gain 1 Foco.
You lose qualquer remaining Foco at the end of the Encontro.

```

```

Foco fora de Combate
Though you can’t gain Foco fora de Combate, you can use your heroic
abilities and effects that cost Foco without spending it. Whenever you
use an Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate that costs Foco, you can’t use
that same Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate De Novo until you earn 1 or
more Victories or finish a Descanso.

```

```

When you use an Habilidade fora de Combate that lets you Gastar
unlimited Foco on its Efeito, you can use it as if you had spent an
amount of Foco equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren’t part of the
core rules for the Tático, but they Músculo appear in future products.)

```

```

Tático Abilities Explained
Many of the Tático’s abilities grant aliados extra Movimento,
dano, and actions. But what’s happening in the fiction to
allow this? The Tático is an incredible strategist and inspiring
Líder who is quick to give commands and inspiration that
causes their aliados to act. The Tático can quickly read
the battlefield, analyze inimigos, and then bark orders and
encouragement that pushes their aliados to greatness. Many of
the names of the Tático’s abilities are the actual commands
they give their friends!

Bônus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 dano for its Grau 1,

As a 1st-Nível Talento, you gain the following features.

**Tradição de Talento **

Psiônica abilities are grouped into categories according to their effects,
with each category comprising um of many Talento traditions:

**Animapatia** abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and Mercado the
souls of living things.
**Cronopatia** abilities allow you to view future and past events, and to
manipulate time to aid aliados and hinder foes.
**Criocinese** abilities allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute
Frio to inimigos and the Ambiente alike.
**Metamorfose** abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your
body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.
**Pirocinese** abilities allow you to create and manipulate Fogo by
interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
**Resopatia** abilities allow you to manipulate matter and space to
create, alter, or displace your Ambiente and the criaturas and
objetos in it.
**Telecinese** abilities allow you to physically manipulate criaturas
and objetos.
**Telepatia** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and influence
the minds of other criaturas.

You choose a Tradição de Talento from the following options: Cronopatia,
Telecinese, or Telepatia. Your Tradição de Talento is your subclass, and
your choice of tradition determines many of the features you’ll gain as
you gain new levels. (Other Talento traditions will be featured in future
products.) ( _Quick Build:_ Telecinese.)

**Clareza e Fadiga **

The Foco and precision of your thoughts grant you a Recurso Heróico
called clarity that empowers your Psiônica abilities.

Clarity durante o Combate
no começo of a Combate Encontro or some other stressful situation
tracked durante o Combate rounds (as determined by the Diretor), you gain

```

clarity equal to your Victories. no começo of each of your turns during
Combate, you gain 1d3 clarity.

```

```

Additionally, the first time each Combate Ronda that a criatura is force
moved, you gain 1 clarity.
You can Gastar clarity you don’t have, pushing that Recurso Heróico
into negative numbers to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your
Razão score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 dano for
each negative point of clarity.

```

```

Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are Fadigado. Some Psiônica
abilities have additional effects if you are already Fadigado or become
Fadigado when you use them. Fadigado effects can still impact you even
after you are no longer Fadigado.
You lose qualquer remaining clarity or reset qualquer negative clarity at the end of
the Encontro.

```

```

Clarity fora de Combate
Though you can’t gain clarity fora de Combate, you can use your
heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it.
Whenever you use an Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate that costs
clarity, you can’t use that same Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate De Novo
until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a Descanso.

```

```

Additionally, whenever you use qualquer Habilidade or Efeito that costs clarity
within 1 minute of using another such Habilidade, you take 1d6 dano
and incur qualquer strain Efeito from using the new Habilidade.
When you use an Habilidade fora de Combate that lets you Gastar
unlimited clarity on its Efeito, such as Telecinese Inferior, you can use it
as if you had spent an amount of clarity equal to your Victories.

Trovador

T

**he whole world’s a stage, and everyone on it,
an actor. No um knows this better than the
Trovador. You find energy in the drama of
everyday Vida and know how to draw spectacle forth
from even the most Mundano of situations. You accent
highs and deepen lows in service to whoever Músculo
witness your Atuar.**

**As a Trovador, you chase drama. The insurmount-
able dangers of the world Músculo cause many a Herói to
cower. But you take to that world stage not intending
to die, but to find out if you are truly alive.**

“História is a tale. Each of

us is just a story we tell

ourselves. Change the story,

and you change the world.”

**Jackson Bootblack**

```
Trovador
```

Boatos, Sociedade.)

1st-Nível Features

As a 1st-Nível Trovador, you gain the following features.

**Papel de Trovador**

Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but
everyone starts somewhere. Your Papel de Trovador is your art form,
summing up the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As
you go about unearthing the drama of everyday Vida and strife, you
choose a Papel de Trovador from the following options, each of which
grants you a Perícia. ( _Quick Build:_ Virtuoso.)

**Autor:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your Magia to
manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You have
the Gabar-se Perícia.
**Duelista:** Drama infuses your every Movimento done in tandem
with another. You perform dances of Morte, putting trust in
your opponent to return your passion in kind. You have the
Ginástica Perícia.
**Virtuoso:** You find drama in Música and song, weaving Magia between
vibrations and filling the audience with your pathos. You have the
Música Perícia and can play an instrument.

Your Papel de Trovador is your subclass, and your choice of Classe act
determines many of the features you’ll gain as you gain new levels.

**Drama**

During battles, you are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and
upside downs of the fray, from which you derive a Recurso Heróico
called drama.

```
Drama durante o Combate
no começo of a Combate Encontro or some other stressful situation
tracked durante o Combate rounds (as determined by the Diretor), you gain
drama equal to your Victories. no começo of each of your turns during
Combate, you gain 1d3 drama.
```

```
Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during a
Combate Encontro:
¥ The first time três or more heroes use an Habilidade on the same Turno,
you gain 2 drama.
¥ The first time qualquer Herói is made Ofegante during the Encontro, you
gain 2 drama.
¥ Whenever a criatura within your Linha of Efeito rolls a natural 19 or
20, you gain 3 drama.
¥ When you or another Herói dies, you gain 10 drama.
```

```
When you are dead, you continue to gain drama during Combate as long
as your body is intact. If you have 30 drama during the Encontro in
which you died, you can come back to Vida with 1 Vigor and 0 drama
(no action required). If you are still dead after the Encontro in which
you died, you can’t gain drama during future encounters.
You lose qualquer remaining drama at the end of the Encontro.
```

```
Drama fora de Combate
Though you can’t gain drama fora de Combate, you can use your
heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it.
Whenever you use an Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate that costs
drama, you can’t use that same Habilidade or Efeito fora de Combate De Novo
until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a Descanso.
```

```
When you use an Habilidade fora de Combate that lets you Gastar
unlimited drama on its Efeito, such as Floreio Artístico, you can use it as if
you had spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.

The Autor Trovador
Abilities like Convidado Especial, Deixa Perdida, and Reviravolta Final allow
the Autor to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by
temporarily removing criaturas from an Encontro, bringing
people back to Vida, or causing a new aliado to appear. These abilities
and features are no more powerful than qualquer other, but they’re
narratively different from shooting rays of Fogo or swinging a
sword.
This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in Draw Steel ,
the Autor knows that the Combate Encontro playing out at your
table is really a story being told sometime later, probably in a
tavern.
When the Autor uses these abilities, they are changing that story.
They rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the telling.
What actually happened is a matter of some debate. Even the
people who were there don’t agree on exactly what took place.
How people remember it is what’s important!
This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it’s too weird for you
or your table, you could always interpret those abilities as a
kind of Magia. A school of conjuring that really does change the
battlefield, which the Autor merely flavors as rewriting the story.
```

```
Kit
You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See Chapter 6: Kits for more
information. ( Criação Rápida: Espadachim Ousado.)

**Parceiro de Cena**

```

a Perícia from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that
NPC. When you enter into a Negociação with a bonded NPC, their
Paciência increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first
time during a Negociação that you personally make an Argumento that
would increase a bonded NPC’s Interesse by 1, you instead increase their
Interesse by 2 (to a maximum of 5).
You can have a number of bonds active equal to your Nível. When you
form a bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must
choose which of your active bonds to lose.
```

**Rotinas**

```
You enter every battle with a set of Atuar abilities at the ready.
Performances are magical presentations (such as songs, dances, poems,
or gymnastic feats) that your aliados can participate in. These abilities
have the Atuar Palavra-Chave. no começo of each Combate Ronda, as
long as you are not Atordoado, dead, or Surpreso, you can either choose a
new Atuar or maintain your current Atuar (no action
required). Your Atuar lasts until you are unable to maintain it or
até o fim do encontro.

a bond with um of those NPCs from that group as if using your Scene
Partner Recurso (above). This bond counts against the limit on active
bonds from your Parceiro de Cena Recurso. While the bond is active,
all heroes present treat their Renome as 2 higher than usual for the
purpose of entering into a Negociação with the bonded NPC.

among the group of criaturas instead, and preventing you from forming
this bond. Until you take action to improve your reputation, all heroes
present take a Desvantagem on tests made to interact with criaturas in the
group using skills from the interpersonal Perícia group. You can still use
your Parceiro de Cena Recurso to find aliados within the group.

# **Kits**

O cavaleiro de armadura brilhante. O sacerdote guerreiro. O atirador de elite.
Censuradores, fúrias, sombras, táticos e trovadores podem explorar esses e outros conceitos arquetípicos usando kits. Um kit é uma combinação de armas, armadura e técnicas de batalha que permitem personalizar seu herói marcial para as batalhas.

## Mudando seu Kit

Sua escolha de kit é sempre adaptável, e seu herói nunca está preso a um kit específico. Se quer mudar seu kit, pode fazê-lo como uma atividade de descanso (veja Descanso no Capítulo O Básico).

## Equipamento do Kit

Cada kit detalha os equipamentos que provê, como categorias de armas, armaduras e escudos. É importante saber qual equipamento um kit usa, pois isso informa a aparência e história do seu herói. O equipamento afeta os cálculos dos benefícios do seu kit, junto com as técnicas de batalha que ele provê. O equipamento também determina o tipo de tesouros
Mágicos e Psiônicos que seu personagem pode utilizar.

A descrição do equipamento em seu kit é limitada à categorias amplas, dando liberdade para que decida as especificidades que melhor se alinhem com sua visão para o seu personagem. Por exemplo, o kit Guisarmista provê armadura média e arma de haste. Um jogador usando esse kit poderia poderia vestir camadas de peles pesadas e empunhar uma lança longa, enquanto outro pode usar um peitoral brilhante e carregar uma alabarda em batalha.

Você pode usar armaduras e empunhar armas que não fazem parte do seu kit, mas se o fizer, não ganha os benefícios do kit.

> **Personalizando Aparência de Equipamento**
>
> Você deve ficar à vontade para descrever o equipamento de uma forma que faça sentido para a história do seu jogo e do seu herói. Por exemplo, se a arma concedida pelo kit do seu herói é da categoria "chicote", ele pode usar um chicote de couro, uma corrente com espinhos ou uma adaga amarrada à uma corda com nós. Um herói que usa armadura pesada pode vestir uma cota de malha, armadura de placas ou tábuas pesadas de madeira amarradas. Sua escolha de equipamento não está limitada aos exemplos nesse livro.

### Categorias de Armaduras de Kit

A armadura que cada kit provê é classificada em uma de cinco categorias, indicando o tipo de proteção que você recebe usando o kit.

#### Nenhuma

Se o kit não provê nenhuma armadura, você pode usar o tipo de roupa que quiser! Vestes, uma túnica estilosa e calças—ou seu personagem pode ficar só de tanga mesmo. Você decide.

#### Armadura Leve

Se um kit contém armadura leve, você pode usar armaduras como jaquetão de tecido, armadura de couro ou camisão de malha.

#### Armadura Média

Se um kit contém armadura média, você pode usar armaduras como gibão de peles grossas, armadura de peitoral, ou armadura de escamas metálicas.

#### Armadura Pesada

Se um kit contém armadura pesada, você provavelmente vai usar armadura metálica da cabeça aos pés. Cota de malha, cota de anéis, ou traje de armadura de placas te protegem mais do que qualquer outra defesa mundana.

#### Escudo

Se um kit contém um escudo, você pode empunhar qualquer formato de escudo, feito do material mundano que quiser. Os melhores escudos tem um brasão impressionante, então vá pensando no seu!

### Categorias de Armas de Kit

As armas que cada kit provê são classificadas em uma de oito categorias, indicando o tipo de armamento que você empunha usando o kit.

#### Arco

Arcos incluem qualquer arma usada para disparar projéteis como flechas e dardos, incluindo bestas, arcos longos e arcos curtos. Essa categoria de arma também inclui armas que lançam balas, pedras, virotes e até pequenas lanças, como fundas e propulsores. Você não precisa contabilizar a munição dessas armas a não ser que o Diretor diga o contrário.

#### Arma de Captura

Armas de captura incluem boleadeiras, redes e outras armas feitas para capturar inimigos e segurá-los.

##### Arma Leve

Armas leves são armas de uma mão que podem ser usadas fazer vários golpes corpo-a-corpo rapidamente. Muitas dessas armas podem ser lançadas, ou usadas como armas secundárias defensivamente. Adagas, espadas curtas, rapieiras, machadinhas e martelos leves são armas leves típicas.

Se seu kit usa arma leve, você pode usar duas armas leves ao mesmo tempo.

#### Arma Média

Armas médias são armas de uma mão que podem ser empunhadas em combate corpo-a-corpo deixando uma mão livre, permitindo que também segure um escudo ou implemento. Machados de batalha, porretes, espadas longas e martelos de guerra são armas médias.

#### Arma Pesada

Armas pesadas são armas corpo-a-corpo de duas mãos com lâminas pesadas ou cabeças concussivas, feitas para machucar seriamente e matar inimigos em um golpe só. Espadas largas, machados grandes, malhos e claymores são exemplos de armas pesadas.

#### Arma de Haste

Armas de Haste são armas corpo-a-corpo de duas mãos com cabos longos que aumentam o alcance do herói. Elas incluem glaives, alabardas, lanças longas e cajados.

#### Golpes Desarmados

Kit que usam golpes desarmados permitem que use seu corpo como arma. Socos, chutes, dedo nos olhos e afins são sua especialidade.

#### Chicote

Armas classificadas como chicote incluem os chicotes, correntes com espinhos, manguais e quaisquer outras armas corpo-a-corpo longas e flexíveis.

### Kits e Tesouros

Quando você obtém um tesouro sobrenatural como uma espada mágica, você pode usá-la caso esteja incluída em uma das categorias de equipamento do seu kit.
A Lâmina da Quintessência é uma arma média, então pode usá-la com os kits de Caçador ou de Armadura Brilhante. No entanto, não pode usá-la com os kits Capa e Adaga ou Cajado e Manto, por que não incluem armas médias, de forma que você não fez as preparações necessárias para usar a arma efetivamente. Você pode usar a Lâmina da Quintessência como arma improvisada, mas não obtém nenhum dos seus bônus ou benefícios.

Se encontrar uma peça de equipamento que quer muito usar, mas que não faz parte do seu kit, pode trocar seu kit como uma atividade de descanso.

## Benefícios e Bônus de Kit

Um kit pode conceder bônus de Vigor, velocidade e estabilidade, bem como de dano e distância de suas habilidades de arma, incluindo seus golpes simples. (Habilidades no Capítulo de Classes tem informações sobre habilidades, palavras-chaves de habilidades, entre outras coisas.)

### Bônus de Vigor

O bônus de Vigor do seu kit é adicionado ao seu Vigor máximo e aumenta a cada escalão.

### Bônus de Velocidade

O bônus de velocidade do seu kit é adicionado a sua velocidade.

### Bônus de Estabilidade

O bônus de estabilidade do seu kit é adicionado a sua estabilidade.

### Bônus de Dano

Kits podem conceder bônus ao dano com habilidades de arma, tanto corpo-a-corpo quanto à distância. Se um kit tem bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo, esse bônus é adicionado ao dano lançado de qualquer habilidade causadora de dano que tenha ambas as palavras-chaves "Arma" e "Corpo-a-corpo". O bônus de dano à distância de um kit é adicionado ao dano lançado de qualquer habilidade causadora de dano que tenha ambas as palavras-chaves "Arma" e "À Distância"

#### Bônus Em Cada Grau

Bônus de dano dos kits aumentam com base no Grau do lançamento de poder de uma habilidade de arma, e são expressos como “+X/+Y/+Z”. O bônus X é adicionado ao Grau 1, o bônus Y é adicionado ao Grau 2 e o bônus Z é adicionado ao Grau 3.

Por exemplo, o kit de Armadura Brilhante tem bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo +2/+2/+2, aumentando o dano de habilidades de arma corpo-a-corpo em cada Grau. O kit Atirador de Elite tem bônus de dano à distância de +0/+0/+4, não fazendo efeito nos Graus 1 e 2 de um lançamento de habilidade, mas aumentando o dano de habilidades de arma à distância em +4 quando obtém Grau 3.

### Bônus de Distância

O bônus de distância corpo-a-corpo de um kit aumenta a distância de habilidades com as palavras-chaves "Corpo-a-corpo" e "Arma". O bônus de distância à distância de um kit aumenta a distância de habilidades com as palavras-chaves "À Distância" e "Arma".

Um bônus de distância não aumenta o tamanho de nenhuma área de efeito de habilidade.

### Bônus de Retirada

Um kit com um bônus de retirada aumenta o número de quadrados que você pode ajustar-se quando usa a ação de movimento Retirar-se (veja Capítulo de Combate).

### Habilidade Clássica de Kit

Cada kit concede uma habilidade clássica, **na qual a distância e dano já incluem os bônus do kit**. Por exemplo, a habilidade Da Ponta ao Cabo do kit Guisarmista tem distância corpo-a-corpo 2 e causa 4, 7 ou 9 de dano dependo do Grau, já com a distância e dano incluindo os bônus do kit.

Para mais detalhes sobre formatação de habilidade, veja Habilidades no Capítulo de Classes.

## Kits de A a Z

Essa seção detalha cada kit, dos quais os bônus e benefícios são resumidos na tabela de kits.

> **Armas Improvisadas**
>
> Armas improvisadas incluem pedras, garrafas, pratos, móveis e qualquer outra coisa que você possa pegar para atirar, bater ou apunhalar um inimigo. Da mesma forma, qualquer arma que não faça parte do seu kit conta como arma improvisada para você. Se não está usando um kit com golpes desarmados, suas mãos e pés são armas improvisadas. Se não está usando um kit e pega uma espada para usar em um golpe simples corpo-a-corpo, a espada conta como arma improvisada.
>
> Armas improvisadas podem ser usadas com habilidades de arma que ganha da sua classe. Por exemplo, muitos heróis focados em corpo-a-corpo escolhem um kit que maximiza sua capacidade corpo-a-corpo, e fazem golpes simples à distância com armas improvisadas. No entanto, não pode usar armas improvisadas com habilidades de arma concedidas pelo seu kit, e não adiciona nenhum bônus especial do seu kit a habilidades de arma quando usa armas improvisadas.

> **Regra Opcional: Perdendo Equipamento**
>
> As regras do jogo esperam que os heróis tenham acesso ao seu equipamento, já que na maior parte do tempo, heróis não se preocupam em sobreviver vários dias em uma masmorra ou contabilizar cada item de equipamento que carregam. No entanto, é possível que seu grupo ocasionalmente queira contar uma história de heróis que são capturados e desarmados, ou que vão a um baile no qual precisam deixar suas armas na entrada. Para tais casos, pode usar as seguintes regras:

- Se seu kit tem armadura e não a está usando, você perde o bônus de Vigor e estabilidade. Se perde apenas seu escudo, seu Vigor é reduzido em 3 por escalão. Desde que esteja carregando o escudo, você não perde o bônus de Vigor, mesmo que não esteja o empunhando ativamente.
- Se seu kit tem arma média ou pesada que não está empunhando, você perde o bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo
- Se seu kit tem arma leve que não está empunhando, você perde os bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo e à distância, e bônus de distância para armas de lançar. Se seu kit também tem um arco, você não perde os bônus para o arco.
- Se seu kit tem arma de haste ou chicote que não está empunhando, você perde o bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo e bônus de distância corpo-a-corpo.
- Se seu kit tem arma de captura que não está empunhando, você perde a habilidade clássica do kit.
- Se seu kit tem um arco que não está empunhando, você perde o bônus de dano à distância e bônus de distância.

# **Aprimoramentos**

Heróis não só lutam contra monstros. Eles exploram, investigam, negociam, e muito mais. Aprimoramentos são recursos que pode usar para customizar seu herói e criar momentos heroicos fora de combate. Junto com as perícias e vários recursos de classe, aprimoramentos fazem seu personagem mais do que apenas um caçador de monstros. Porém, mesmo que esses recursos tenham sido criados para uso fora de combate, muitos são versáteis o suficiente para também serem usados em batalha.

Você recebe um aprimoramento da sua carreira e pode escolher outros aprimoramentos pela sua classe conforme seu Nível aumenta.

## Tipos de Aprimoramento

Seis tipos de aprimoramentos são disponíveis para seu personagem. Cinco deles refletem as categorias dos quatro grupos de perícias (veja Perícias no Capítulo de Testes), e incluem muitos aprimoramentos relacionados às perícias desses grupos. O sexto tipo de aprimoramento permite que qualquer personagem acesse alguns poderes supernaturais.

**Aprimoramentos de Criação** melhoram sua capacidade de utilização de materiais para criação e tornam você um especialista nas coisas que cria.

**Aprimoramentos de Exploração** facilitam a travessia e exploração de diferentes ambientes.

**Aprimoramentos Interpessoais** melhoram suas interações com outras criaturas.

**Aprimoramentos de Intriga** deixam você mais efetivo investigando mistérios e descobrindo a verdade, enquanto mantém seus segredos escondidos.

**Aprimoramentos de Conhecimento** melhoram sua maestria da memória, idiomas e conhecimento de tópicos variados.

**Aprimoramentos Sobrenaturais** dão acesso ao uso de magia e psiônica para influenciar o mundo ao seu redor.

Sempre que um recurso permite que ganhe um aprimoramento, esse recurso determina qual tipo de aprimoramento pode escolher.

### Aprimoramentos de Criação

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos de criação em ordem alfabética.

#### Área de Especialização

Escolha uma perícia que você já tem do grupo de perícias de criação. Sempre que obtiver Grau 1 em teste fácil ou médio usando essa perícia, você o trata como Grau 2. Além disso, se passar 1 minuto inspecionando um objeto relacionado a essa perícia, pode estimar seu valor e descobrir qualquer falha em sua construção.

#### Artesão Inspirado

Quando faz lançamento de projeto usando perícia do grupo de perícias de criação, pode gastar um Vale Heroico para fazer outro lançamento de projeto para o mesmo projeto como parte da mesma atividade de descanso. Não pode usar esse aprimoramento mais de uma vez por descanso.

#### Artesão Viajante

Em qualquer dia no qual não descansa, pode gastar 1 hora ininterrupta trabalhando em um projeto de criação usando uma perícia que tiver do grupo de perícias de criação. Se o fizer, ganha 1d10 pontos de projeto para esse projeto.

#### Gambiarra

Sem precisar fazer um teste—e mesmo sem ferramentas—você pode rapidamente criar ou consertar um item mundano ou equipamento relacionado a uma perícia que você tem do grupo de perícias de criação. Esse item dura por 1 hora ou funciona por um único uso ou ativação (o que ocorrer primeiro, conforme determinação do Diretor), depois quebra de forma irreparável. Por exemplo, se tem a perícia Carpintaria, pode reparar uma ponte de madeira precária por tempo o suficiente para um grupo de criaturas cruzá-la, ou construir uma pá simples feita de madeira que pode usar por 1 hora.

#### Habilidoso

Sempre que fizer um teste para criar algo e não tiver perícia que se aplique a esse teste, você ganha +1 de bônus para o lançamento de poder.

#### Mestre Artesão

Sempre que fizer um teste como parte de um projeto de criação ou pequisa que usa uma perícia que você já tem do grupo de perícias de criação, pode fazer dois lançamentos de poder e usar qualquer um deles.

> **Aprimoramentos e Testes**
>
> A existência de aprimoramentos específicos não impede um herói de tentar tarefas relacionadas a um aprimoramento sem ter esse aprimoramento. Com exceção dos aprimoramentos sobrenaturais, um Diretor pode sempre permitir que um herói tente uma tarefa mundana mencionada em um aprimoramento fazendo um teste. Aprimoramentos são especiais por permitirem a um herói tentar tarefas específicas sem um teste, e geralmente concedem resultados melhores que um sucesso em teste—ou mesmo um teste com recompensa—concederia.
>
> Por exemplo, um herói pode segurar um aliado caindo se não tem o aprimoramento "Deixa comigo!"? Um Diretor certamente pode permitir, mas pode decidir que o herói precisa ter sucesso em um teste de Músculo para realizar a tarefa, usando sua ação principal ou manobra para se preparar. Ser capaz de segurar um aliado automaticamente como uma reação livre é o que o aprimoramento provê!

### Aprimoramentos de Exploração

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos de exploração em ordem alfabética.

#### Amigapulta

Como uma manobra, você pode pegar um aliado disposto ou objeto do seu tamanho ou menor, e então empurrar verticalmente esse alvo até um número de quadrados igual ao dobro do seu valor de Músculo. Se uma criatura que empurrar cair como resultado desse movimento, a distância efetiva da queda é reduzida por um número de quadrados igual ao dobro do seu valor de Músculo. Quando usa esse aprimoramento, não pode usá-lo novamente até ganhar 1 ou mais vitórias.

#### Caçador Camuflado

Quando você está na natureza, assim que estiver escondido de uma criatura você não precisa de cobertura ou encobrimento para seguir escondido dela.

#### Deixa comigo!

Sempre que um aliado disposto que cai aterrizaria em você ou adjacente a você, você pode segurá-lo com segurança como uma reação livre. Nenhum de vocês sofre dano da queda do aliado.

#### Encantador de Monstros

Você pode usar a perícia de Trato Animal para interagir com criaturas não-sapientes que não são animais.

#### Líder de Equipe

No começo de um teste de grupo ou teste de montagem, você pode gastar um Vale Heroico. Se o fizer, todos os participantes fazem testes como se também tivessem qualquer perícia que você tem do grupo de perícias de exploração.

#### Musculoso

Sempre que falha um teste de Músculo, você pode perder Vigor igual a 1d6 + seu Nível para melhorar o resultado do teste em um Grau. Você só pode usar esse aprimoramento uma vez por teste.

#### Sábio da Floresta

Quando você faz um teste usando uma perícia do grupo de perícias de exploração e ao menos um dos dados d10 lançado foi 1, pode lançar novamente esse d10. Você só pode usar esse aprimoramento uma vez por teste.

#### Se Esforce!

Durante testes de montagem, sempre que você faz um teste para auxiliar um teste e obtém Grau 1, o teste auxiliado não recebe desvantagem. Além disso, uma vez por teste de montagem, você pode tornar um resultado Grau 1 de um teste de aliado em Grau 2.

#### Sentido de Perigo

Sempre que está em um ambiente natural (mas não em um assentamento nesse ambiente) você ganha vantagem em testes usando a perícia de Atenção e não pode ser surpreso. Além disso, você tem uma conexão com a natureza que o avisa de qualquer desastre natural iminente dentro das próximas 72 horas, ainda que não saiba exatamente o que acontecerá (terremoto, incêndio florestal, entre outras coisas).

#### Trabalho em Equipe

Durante seu primeiro turno em qualquer teste de montagem, você pode fazer um teste e também auxiliar no teste de outro herói.

### Aprimoramentos Interpessoais

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos interpessoais em ordem alfabética.

#### Charmoso e Mentiroso

Se você falhar um teste usando a perícia Mentir, você não sofre nenhuma consequência associada com essa falha. Além disso, durante uma negociação, você pode ser pego mentindo uma vez sem consequências negativas. Quando você usa qualquer dos benefícios desse aprimoramento, você não pode usar esse aprimoramento novamente até ganhar 1 ou mais vitórias.

#### Desculpe o meu amigo...

Quando um aliado dentro de 5 quadrados de distância falha um teste de Presença, você pode intervir e fazer um teste de presença com desvantagem, com seu lançamento substituindo o lançamento do aliado. Esse aprimoramento só pode ser usado uma vez por teste, mesmo que mais de um personagem o tenha.

#### Deslumbrante

Sempre que uma criatura assiste a você cantar, dançar ou atuar como personagem (como ator, não apenas em disfarce) por 1 minuto ininterrupto ou mais, você ganha vantagem em qualquer teste feito para influenciar essa criatura por 1 hora após o fim dessa apresentação.

#### Detector de Mentiras

Em resposta a outra criatura comunicando informações para você, você pode gastar um Vale Heroico para determinar se essas informações contém algo que a criatura sabe que é mentira. Caso o faça, você sabe quais são as mentiras, mas não sabe a verdade sobre elas.

#### Diplomacia Muscular

Sempre que você faz um teste que usa as perícias Gabar-se, Flertar ou Intimidar, você pode usar Músculo em vez de qualquer outra característica que o teste exija.

#### Então, Me Diga Uma Coisa...

Sempre que você tem sucesso em um teste de Presença para influenciar uma ou mais criaturas, você pode perguntar a uma criatura que influenciou uma pergunta complementar depois do teste ser resolvido, que ela deve responder honestamente. À discrição do Diretor a criatura não precisa responder a pergunta completamente—ou pode nem responder—caso a resposta coloque a ela ou a uma pessoa amada em perigo.

#### Harmonizador

Você pode fazer um teste de Presença usando a perícia de Música para influenciar criaturas que não tem emoções ou que não podem entender você. Além disso, por uma vez durante uma negociação, você pode tocar música quando um aliado faz um argumento, para dar vantagem a esse aliado em seu teste.

#### Leitura Corporal

Sempre que você faz um teste para ler uma pessoa e obtém Grau 3, você percebe vários sinais que revelam os verdadeiros sentimentos dessa pessoa. Qualquer teste que faça para ler essa pessoa no futuro ganha vantagem.

#### Livro Aberto

Sempre que você fala sozinho com uma criatura, você pode fazer uma pergunta sobre essa criatura que geralmente seria suspeita ou ofensiva. Se ela escolher não responder honestamente, ela simplesmente desvia ou redireciona a pergunta, sem nenhuma consequência. Se ela escolher responder honestamente, essa criatura pode imediatamente fazer uma pergunta sobre você, que você precisa responder honestamente.

#### Monólogo Cativante

Sempre que você não está em combate, você pode gritar para atrair a atenção de criaturas que possam ouvir dentro de 10 quadrados de distância de você. Cada criatura que não é hostil com você ouve o que disser por 1 minuto ininterrupto ou mais, ou até sentir perigo ou qualquer forma de dano iminente. Enquanto criaturas estão ouvindo você, cada um dos seus aliados ganha vantagem em testes para evitar serem percebidos por essas criaturas.

### Aprimoramentos de Intriga

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos de intriga em ordem alfabética.

#### Cara Comum

Se você gastar 10 minutos ou menos interagindo com uma criatura que não conhecia você antes, você pode causar com que essa criatura esqueça o seu rosto quando partir. Se perguntada como descrevê-lo, a criatura dará apenas descrições vagas, vazias e inúteis. Além disso, se você gastar 1 hora ou mais criando um disfarce, você automaticamente obtém Grau 2 em qualquer teste no qual possa usar a perícia de Disfarce. Se você tiver a perícia de Disfarce, você automaticamente obtém Grau 3 no teste.

#### Contatos Criminais

Você tem acesso a uma rede de contatos criminais. Como uma atividade de descanso em um assentamento, você pode fazer uma pergunta aos seus contatos fazendo um teste de Presença. Com um Grau 2, você aprende uma informação que seria comum entre criminosos—a entrada secreta de um prédio, a localização de um criminoso local foragido, o nome do líder da guilda de ladrões local, por exemplo. Com um Grau 3, você pode, em vez disso, aprender conhecimento que seria incomum entre criminosos desde que tal informação exista—a localização de um esconderijo de tesouros local, a localização de uma arma do crime usada no assassinato de um nobre local, o nome de um NPC secretamente financiando a guilda de assassinos local, por exemplo.

#### Fuga Sutil

Você ganha vantagem em testes feitos para escapar amarras. Tendo 1 minuto ininterrupto, você pode escapar qualquer amarra mundana sem fazer testes. Além disso, não é imediatamente óbvio que escapou as amarras até que faça algo que deixe claro que escapou (se livrar das amarras ou usar uma habilidade que cause dano a uma ou mais criaturas, por exemplo).

#### Mestre de Disfarces

Você pode colocar ou remover um disfarce como parte de qualquer teste que você faça usando a perícia Esconder-se, ou enquanto usa a manobra Esconder-se.

#### Sortudo

Sempre que falha um teste usando qualquer perícia do grupo de perícias de intriga, você pode perder Vigor igual a 1d6 + seu Nível para melhorar o resultado do teste em um Grau. Você só pode usar esse aprimoramento uma vez por teste.

#### Travar as Engrenagens

Sempre que uma armadilha mundana se ativa dentro de 3 quadrados de distância de você, você pode se mover até 3 quadrados até ela. Se esse movimento deixa você adjacente a qualquer dos mecanismos da armadilha, você pode sabotar a armadilha, prevenindo que se ative. Enquanto você ficar adjacente ao mecanismo, a armadilha não pode se ativar a não ser que uma tentativa de desarmá-la falhe.

### Aprimoramentos de Conhecimento

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos de conhecimento em ordem alfabética.

#### Especialista

Você é um dos principais especialistas em uma assunto. Escolha uma perícia que você tem do grupo de perícias de conhecimento. Você sempre tem vantagem dupla em testes feitos para relembrar conhecimento usando essa perícia. Além disso, seu conhecimento de especialista concede notoriedade em áreas relacionadas à perícia escolhida. Você trata seu renome como sendo maior em 1 quando negocia com um NPC que sabe da sua reputação, ou 2 se eles tem a mesma perícia que você escolheu.

#### Eu Já Li Sobre Esse Lugar

Cada vez que entra em um assentamento que nunca visitou antes, você pode perguntar ao Diretor uma das seguintes questões:

- Quem é a figura pública mais influente nesse assentamento?
- Quem nesse assentamento seria mais amigável conosco agora?
- O que esse assentamento mais precisa de forasteiros?

Se o Diretor não tem uma resposta para a pegunta que fizer, ou não quer responder, você pode fazer outra pergunta.

#### Linguista

Você automaticamente aprende dois novos idiomas, desde que regularmente os ouvia sendo falados ou via em escrito anteriormente. Além disso, se você ficar 7 dias ou mais em um lugar onde regularmente ouve ou lê um idioma que não conhece, você pode aprender o suficiente para conversar ou entender escritas básicas. Tendo conhecido um idioma dessa forma, você pode subsequentemente aprendê-lo usando o projeto de pesquisa de Aprender um Novo Idioma com a metade do custo normal de pontos de projeto (veja Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre).

#### Mas Eu Sei Quem Sabe...

Sempre que você falha um teste de relembrar conhecimento usando uma perícia do grupo de perícias de conhecimento, você instintivamente lembra da localização mais próxima onde a informação que procura pode ser encontrada. Ela pode ser a torre de um sábio local, a biblioteca de uma cidade próxima, algum lugar nas profundezas de uma masmorra, ou qualquer outra localização que o Diretor determine. O Diretor pode decidir que certos conhecimentos não podem ser revelados dessa forma.

#### Memória Fotográfica

Sua mente é uma enciclopédia, ainda que não seja sempre fácil de organizá-la. Quando termina um descanso, escolha uma perícia do grupo de perícias de conhecimento que você não tem. Você tem essa perícia até terminar seu próximo descanso. Além disso, se você passar 1 minuto ininterrupto ou mais lendo qualquer página de texto, pode memorizar seu conteúdo, permitindo que memorize livros inteiros tendo tempo suficiente.

#### Mestre Sábio

Sempre que faz um teste como parte de um projeto de criação ou projeto de pesquisa usando uma perícia do grupo de perícias de conhecimento, você pode fazer o lançamento de poder duas vezes e usar qualquer um dos lançamentos.

#### Multidisciplinar

Sempre que faz um teste de relembrar conhecimento e não tem uma perícia que se plique a esse teste, você ganha +1 de bônus para o lançamento de poder.

#### Sábio Viajante

Em qualquer dia no qual não descansa, pode gastar 1 hora ininterrupta trabalhando em um projeto de pesquisa usando uma perícia que tiver do grupo de perícias de conhecimento. Se o fizer, ganha 1d10 pontos de projeto para esse projeto.

### Aprimoramentos Sobrenaturais

Essa seção apresenta os aprimoramentos sobrenaturais em ordem alfabética.

#### Familiar

Um espírito sobrenatural que toma a forma de um pequeno animal ou objeto animado específico escolheu ser seu familiar—ou adotá-lo como seu familiar.

O espírito usa a ficha de criatura de Familiar.

O familiar pode segurar pequenos objetos na sua boca ou garras, mas não pode realizar atividades que geralmente requerem mão (abrir uma porta, desenrolar um pergaminho, entre outras). Ele não podem prejudicar outras criaturas ou objetos. Eles podem flanquear durante um combate, mas só com você.

Se seu familiar for destruído, você pode restaurá-lo como uma atividade de descanso, ou gastando uma Recuperação como uma ação principal para trazê-lo de volta à existência em um quadrado desocupado adjacente a você.

##### Ficha de Criatura de Familiar

|      Familiar       |          -          |          Nível -          |           -           |         VdE -          |
| :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------: |
| **1PP**<br>Tamanho  | **5**<br>Velocidade | **2x seu Nível**<br>Vigor | **0**<br>Estabilidade | **-**<br>Golpe Simples |
| **-**<br>Imunidades | **-**<br>Movimento  |                           | **-**<br>Com Capitão  |  **-**<br>Weaknesses   |
|  **-3**<br>Músculo  | **+2**<br>Agilidade |      **0**<br>Razão       |   **0**<br>Intuição   |   **+1**<br>Presença   |

**Telepático**
Enquanto você e seu Familiar estão dentro de 10 quadrados de distância um do outro, vocês podem se comunicar telepaticamente e compartilhar seus sentidos. Enquanto compartilham seus sentidos, ambos se beneficiam de seus próprios sentidos simultaneamente.

#### Força Invisível

Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

**Força Invisível**

\*Você manipula um pequeno objeto com sua mente.

| **Psiônica, À Distância** |                     **Manobra** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------: |
| **📏 À Distância 10**     | **🎯 Um objeto de tamanho 1PP** |

**Efeito:** Você pode agarrar ou manipular o objeto alvo com sua mente, movendo o objeto até um número de quadrados igual ao seu valor de Razão, Intuição ou Presença (sua escolha). Você pode usar essa habilidade para abrir maçanetas, puxar alavancas, entre outras coisas. Você pode manipular qualquer parte pequena móvel de um objeto maior, desde que a peça esteja desatendida e tenha tamanho 1PP. Você não pode usar essa habilidade para quebrar uma parte de um objeto maior.

#### Ler Criatura

Como uma manobra, escolha uma criatura dentro de 10 quadrados de distância. Se essa criatura é do seu Nível ou de Nível menor, você aprender as palavras-chaves da sua ficha de criatura (Demônio, Humanoide, Morto-Vivo, entre outras).

#### Psicometria

Quando você segura um objeto em sua mão por 1 minuto ininterrupto, pode sentir se ele carrega alguma ressonância emocional. Objetos com ressonância emocional podem incluir presentes preciosos, armas do crime ou recordações pessoais. Se o Diretor determina que o objeto carrega ressonância emocional, você aprende a emoção mais dominante associada ao objeto, e então recebe uma visão que responde uma das seguintes perguntas:

- Qual o nome da pessoa que deixou sua marca emocional nesse objeto?
- Por que essa emoção permanece no objeto?
- Quanto tempo passou desde que o objeto foi segurado pela pessoa que deixou a emoção que permanece nele?

Depois de fazer uma pergunta, você pode escolher se aprofundar fazendo uma outra pergunta da lista, mas se o fizer será dominado por emoções que não são suas. Você recebe desvantagem em testes de Intuição e Presença até terminar um descanso, e não pode usar novamente esse aprimoramento enquanto sofre essa desvantagem.

#### Ritualista

Você pode gastar 1 minuto ininterrupto para realizar um ritual mágico de bênção, tendo como alvo você mesmo ou um aliado disposto que toca. O alvo tem vantagem dupla no próximo teste que fizer no próximo minuto. O alvo não pode usar esse benefício em uma atividade que demore mais de 1 minuto.

#### Sussurro Psíquico

Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

**Sussurro Psíquico**

_Você manda uma mensagem telepática unilateral para um amigo._

| **Psiônica, À Distância** |      **Manobra** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------: |
| **📏 À Distância 10**     | \*\*🎯 Um aliado |

**Efeito:** Desde que o alvo entenda um ou mais idiomas, você manda uma mensagem telepática para ele que demore 10 segundos ou menos para falar. O alvo sabe de quem a mensagem veio e pode decidir ignorá-la, bem como quaisquer mensagens subsequentes.

#### Truque Arcano

Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

**Truque Arcano**

_Você conjura um feitiço interessante que cria um pequeno mas impressionante efeito mágico._

| **Magia**                      | **Ação Principal** |
| ------------------------------ | -----------------: |
| **📏 Personagem; veja abaixo** |  **🎯 Personagem** |

**Efeito:** Escolha um dos efeitos a seguir:

- Você teleporta um objeto de tamanho 1P ou menor adjacente a você até um quadrado desocupado adjacente a você.
- Até o início do seu próximo turno, uma parte do seu corpo dispara uma rajada de faíscas barulhentas inofensivas que iluminam cada quadrado adjacente a você.
- Você acende ou apaga (sua escolha) todas as fontes de luz mundanas de tamanho 1G ou menores adjacentes a você.
- Você transforma até 1 libra (453g) de alimentos comestíveis que toca para deixá-los deliciosos ou nojentos.
- Até o fim do seu próximo turno, você faz seu corpo exalar um odor específico que já cheirou antes. Esse odor pode ser sentido por cada criatura dentro de 5 quadrados de distância de você, mas não pode impor nenhuma condição ou outra inconveniência para essas criaturas.
- Você coloca uma inscrição mágica na superfície de um objeto mundano que toca, ou pode remover uma inscrição que foi colocada por você ou outra criatura usando Truque Arcano.
- Você toca um objeto de tamanho 1PP para o cobrir com uma ilusão que o faz parecer outro objeto. Qualquer criatura que manipula o objeto percebe a ilusão. A ilusão termina quando para de tocar o objeto.

# **Complicações**

Além das habilidades e traços concedidos por Linhagem e Classe, seu herói pode ter algo mais que o faça... especial. Talvez um elemental de terra viva no seu corpo. Quem sabe a sua lâmina sobrenatural que assola seus inimigos também se alimenta da sua vitalidade. Uma complicação é um traço opcional que você pode escolher para enriquecer a história de fundo do seu herói, oferecendo um benefício positivo e também uma inconveniência negativa.

Já que complicações são opcionais, confirme com seu Diretor antes de escolher uma. Além disso, mesmo que você possa determinar a complicação do seu heróis, lembre-se que o Diretor tem palavra final em como essa complicação afeta a história. A inconveniência da sua complicação pode desempenhar um grande papel na campanha, tanto por receber oportunidades para removê-la, quanto por estar sempre pairando sobre você, o levando a tomar decisões difíceis. Qualquer dessas opções resulta em grandes narrativas, então aceite dar ao Diretor o controle quando seleciona uma complicação. A história será enriquecida com isso!

## Benefício e Inconveniência

Sua complicação concede ao seu heróis tanto um benefício quanto uma inconveniência. Alguns desses benefícios e inconveniências são mecânicos, enquanto outros são narrativos. Os benefícios e inconveniências de uma complicação aprofundam e deixam mais interessante a sua conexão com o jogo, e provém ganchos para o Diretor melhor incluir o seu herói na história da campanha.

Nem todos os benefícios e inconveniências de complicação carregam o mesmo peso, mas cada benefício é equilibrado pela sua inconveniência. Se sua complicação tem um lado positivo poderoso, prepare-se para ter lado negativo igualmente impactante.

## Modificando a História

Consultando seu Diretor, você pode modificar a narrativa de uma complicação para melhor representar sua visão da história de fundo do seu personagem—ou mudá-la completamente. Por exemplo, se escolher Contrato Infernal como sua complicação,seu herói pode fazer um acordo com um celestial ou general morto-vivo em vez de um diabo!

Muitos dos detalhes de cada complicação são vagos de propósito, para que seja possível conectar a complicação com o resto da sua história de fundo. Se sua complicação ocorreu durante um ataque, acidente ou outro evento, você decide os detalhes específicos desse evento e de quaisquer das criaturas envolvidas.

## Escolhendo uma Complicação

Você pode escolher a complicação do seu personagem entre todas as opções abaixo. Ou ainda, para maximizar o aspecto de que seja uma parte inesperada da sua vida, você pode fazer um lançamento na Tabela de Complicações.

Complicações são apresentadas em ordem alfabética.

**Tabela de Complicações**

### Abençoado pelas Fadas

Seu nascimento foi testemunhado por fadas. Uma fada amigável abençoou você, concedendo força pra que pudesse se defender. Em contrapartida, uma fada hostil concedeu a você uma vida repleta de perigo para que possa provar essa força.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** No começo de cada encontro de combate, você pode escolher ganhar 1 recurso heroico adicional. Se o fizer, o Diretor ganha 3 de Malícia.

### Alma de Relâmpago

Você foi pego em uma tempestade e atingido por raios—mas algo o salvou da morte. Talvez tenha sido um milagre divino, uma dádiva psiônica latente, ou a magia de um Elementalista solícito; mas você absorveu a eletricidade em seu corpo. Ela está sempre presente agora, estalando sob a sua pele.
**Benefício:** Sempre que você recupera Vigor durante o combate, você ganha 1 impulso. Sempre que gastar um impulso para causar dano adicional, você pode tornar esse dano adicional em dano elétrico.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que você estiver molhado, você tem fraqueza a dano 5.

### Amante de Adrenalina

Você vive pelo perigo. Sejam em batalha ou em perigos mundanos, você pode transcender seus limites normais—e quando prova dessa emoção, você quer mais.
**Benefício:** Cada vez que seu grupo alcança 2, 4, e 6 Vitórias, você ganha um Vale Heroico para o grupo.
**Inconveniência:** No começo de uma nova sessão de jogo, o grupo não ganha um Vale Heroico pelo seu personagem.

### Amnésia

Você não se lembra do seu passado antes do... acidente. You have no memory of your past before the ... incident. Com sorte, você vai recuperar sua memória e descobrir o que foi esse acidente. Por enquanto, você precisa de amigos para que não esteja sozinho quando o passado bater na sua porta.
**Benefício:** Você tem um item sobrenatural—um adereço de 1º escalão à sua escolha (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas) que pode ser conectado à sua vida anterior.
**Inconveniência:** Você recebe uma desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para relembrar de conhecimentos.

### Anti-herói

Você era um vilão. Você está (praticamente) redimido agora, mas em momentos de desespero, você ocasionalmente tira forças da raiva e do ódio que antes dominavam a sua vida. Nesses momentos, até seus amigos não sabem exatamente de qual lado você está. Porém, eles não precisam se preocupar. Quando você abandonou o mal, se tornou impossível voltar atrás. Você tem inimigos demais do outro lado.
**Benefício:** Você tem 3 Vales de Anti-herói. Sempre que você usa uma habilidade ou outro efeito que custa seu recurso heroico, pode gastar 1 Vale de Anti-herói em vez de 1 recurso heroico. Sempre que tiver menos de 3 Vales de Anti-herói e ganhar 1 Vale Heroico para seu grupo por seu atos, em vez disso você recupera 1 Vale de Anti-herói.
**Inconveniência:** Enquanto tiver menos de 3 Vales de Anti-herói, você exala uma aura de aspecto vilanesco. Você e cada aliado dentro de 5 quadrados de distância de você recebem uma desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para interagir com outras criaturas.

### Aprendiz Promissor

Você foi aprendiz de um ofício de criação. Seu mentor disse que você tinha um dom especial e poderia um dia se tornar um mestre desse ofício. Porém, antes de completar seu treinamento, seu mentor foi morto.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de criação. Além disso, escolha uma das suas perícias de criação, você ganha vantagem em qualquer teste que use essa perícia.
**Inconveniência:** A pessoa que matou seu mentor amaldiçoou você. Você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste que não use uma das suas perícias.

### Arma Amaldiçoada

Quando você era jovem, você achou ou recebeu uma arma mágica. Desde então, você sempre a carregou ao seu lado, deixando que ela o inspirasse a viver de forma heroica—mesmo que essa arma seja amaldiçoada.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma arma com níveis da sua escolha (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas).
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano 2.

### Autodidata

Enquanto seus colegas aprendiam seus ofícios em escolas chiques, você aprimorou suas aptidões nas ruas, guiado apenas pelo seu instinto. O que você perdeu em requinte e compreensão tática, você compensa com força bruta.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** No começo de cada um de seus turnos durante o combate, você pode escolher não ganhar seu recurso heroico até o início do seu próximo turno. Se o fizer, seus golpes ganham bônus de dano igual ao seu maior valor de característica até o início do seu próximo turno.

### Caçado

Você há muito tempo tem se mantido um passo à frente de um perseguidor—talvez um caçador de recompensas que pretende o entregar para a justiça, um ressurgido, ou um assassino que quer te matar. Eventualmente você terá a força para enfrentar esse perseguidor. Por enquanto, você vive como um foragido.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de intriga. Além disso, sempre que uma ou mais criaturas estejam te perseguindo, você pode limpar seus rastros como atividade de descanso. Quando o faz, qualquer criatura que o persegue perde os seus rastros e os da localização do seu grupo, precisando recomeçar sua busca.
**Inconveniência:** Cada vez que você ganha renome, seu perseguidor descobre sua localização. Se não limpar seus rastros ou partir para uma nova localização, você será visitado por agentes do seu perseguidor dentro de 1d10 dias. Se permanecer por mais tempo que isso, seu perseguidor te encontra.

### Caçador

Você está caçando alguém ou algo—talvez um criminoso foragido, uma pessoa que te prejudicou, ou um monstro ou fera perigosa. Você não vai descansar até confrontar seu alvo.
**Benefício:** Escolha uma perícia dentre as seguintes:

- Interrogar (do grupo de perícias interpessoais)
- Atenção, Bisbilhotar, Procurar ou Rastrear (do grupo de perícias de intriga)
- Criminalidade, Boatos ou Sociedade (do grupo de perícias de conhecimento)
  Você tem essa perícia, e ganha vantagem em testes para encontrar ou descobrir pistas sobre o seu alvo. 
  **Inconveniência:** Você está tão obcecado em encontrar seu alvo que recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste para rastrear outras criaturas.

### Cavaleiro de Falcão

Você viaja com um falcão gigante que roubou dos Senhores de Falcões. (Veja Vasloria no Capítulo O Básico). Você pode ter sido um senhor de falcão, ou talvez escapado da prisão deles. Ter um falcão gigante como companheiro causa alguns transtornos e perigos, mas eles são um preço pequeno a se pagar pela liberdade do céu aberto.
**Benefício:** Desde que você não esteja em um prédio ou outra estrutura, você pode gastar 1 minuto ininterrupto para chamar o seu falcão gigante (veja o Capítulo de Humanos em _Draw Steel: Monstros_), que serve como sua montaria. Você dispensar o falcão a qualquer momento (nenhuma ação necessária). O falcão não entra em prédios, masmorras ou outras estruturas, e não aceita ser montado por ninguém além de você. Se o falcão sofre dano ou morre, você pode restaurá-lo ao seu Vigor máximo como uma atividade de descanso.
**Inconveniência:** Pessoas que sabem da origem da sua montaria tem medo de interagir com você, já que se preocupam que os Senhores de Falcões virão atrás deles por terem se associado com você. Você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para influenciar qualquer pessoa que saiba sobre os Senhores de Falcões e que tenha visto você com o seu falcão gigante. Tais pessoas podem também denunciar você para os Senhores de Falcões, que podem vir procurá-lo à discrição do Diretor.

### Coabitação Espiritual

Um espírito sobrenatural ocupa o seu corpo, se revezando com você no controle do seu corpo. Você e o espírito compartilham os mesmos objetivos de curto prazo e colaboram com seus companheiros da mesma forma, ainda que possam ter diferentes personalidades, trejeitos ou objetivos de longo prazo.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** No começo de cada dia, lance um d6. Num resultado de 1–4, você controla seu corpo; de 5-6, é o espirito que o controla. Alternativamente, se você e o espírito estiverem de bem, você pode escolher quem controla o corpo a cada dia. Escolha três das suas perícias. Você só pode usar essas perícias quando controla seu corpo. Depois escolha três novas perícias, você as ganha mas só pode usá-las quando o espírito está em controle do corpo.

### Colar de Cão-de-Guerra

Você usa uma coleira de lealdade dos cães de guerra de Ajax (Veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_). Você conseguiu alterar a coleira para que exploda para fora, mantendo você seguro
**Benefício:** Mesmo que você seja um cão de guerra, outros cães de guerra não podem usar sua habilidade de Promoção Póstuma em você enquanto usa sua coleira. Além disso, você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Aposentadoria Póstuma**
_Você faz sua coleira modificada explodir._

| **Área, Magia**   |                 **Manobra** |
| ----------------- | --------------------------: |
| **📏 1 Explosão** | **🎯 Cada inimigo na área** |

**Efeito:** Sua coleira de lealdade detona, causando dano de fogo igual a 5 + o seu nível para cada alvo. Após usar essa habilidade, você não pode usá-la novamente até passar 1 minuto ininterrupto fora de combate reajustando a coleira.

---

**Inconveniência:** Cada vez que você usa sua habilidade de Aposentadoria Póstuma, o Diretor pode gastar 3 de Malícia para fazer sua coleira falhar e também causar o dano a você, além dos alvos normais.

### Consciência Pesada

O mundo está em apuros—e parte da culpa é sua. Talvez você tenha ajudado um vilão a tomar o poder, ou acidentalmente libertado um demônio de sua prisão. Agora reparar o dano que causou é sua missão.
**Benefício:** Você está decidido a se manter vivo para reparar o dano que causou. Quando seu Vigor alcança o valor negativo do seu valor de ofegante, você pode usar uma reação livre para gastar uma recuperação.
**Inconveniência:** Muitas pessoas culpam você pelo mal que causou. Elas podem ser antipáticas ou hostis com você—e você compreende o ponto de vista delas. Você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para interagir com pessoas que saibam o que você fez, e em golpes dados contra tais criaturas.

### Contrato Infernal

Você fez um pacto(talvez sem saber) com um arquidiabo que o deixou à serviço dessa criatura infernal. Quando você descobriu esse acordo, você foi levado para as Sete Cidades do Inferno, onde algumas das mentes mais brilhantes da timescape ensinaram você a lutar. O arquidiabo permite que use esse conhecimento como quiser... Até precisar de algum favor seu.
**Benefício:** Sempre que você está presente em um combate no qual nenhum lado tenha criaturas surpresas, o seu lado determina quem age primeiro em um lançamento de 4 ou mais em um d10 (Veja Ronda de Combate no Capítulo de Combate).
**Inconveniência:** O arquidiabo ocasionalmente pede que você derrote inimigos em seu nome. Se você recusar, seu patrono infernal envia diabos atrás de você e de pessoas com quem você se importa.

### Contrato Infernal Abusivo

Você fez um pacto com um diabo. Não foi um bom pacto, por que não era um diabo bom. Porém, é tarde demais pra se arrepender, por que sua alma está perdida a não ser que encontre uma brecha pu convença o diabo a anular esse acordo.
**Benefício:** Escolha um dos seguintes benefícios:

- Você ganha 2 de renome.
- Sua riqueza aumenta em 2.
- Você ganha +3 de bônus de Vigor.
  **Inconveniência:** Seu corpo tem uma marca diabólica. Qualquer criatura que conheça sobre Religião e perceba essa marca sabe que sua alma pertence ao inferno, impondo desvantagem em qualquer teste que você faça para interagir com essas criaturas(a não ser que elas curtam esse tipo de coisa). Além disso, quando você morrer, sua alma vai para o inferno e você não pode ter sua vida restaurada.

### Coração Gelado

Em um local remoto, você se perdeu em uma tempestade de neve e foi dado como morto. Porém, um destino ou poder desconhecido o manteve vivo, lhe devolvendo a vida mas deixando sua pele congelada e seus olhos pálidos.
**Benefício:** Você tem imunidade a frio 5. Além disso, sempre que você dá um golpe que causa dano sem tipo, em vez disso esse golpe pode causar dano de frio.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a fogo 5.

### Corpo Hospedeiro

“Não se assustem! Não somos esse humanoide que parecemos ser. Somos uma colônia de fungos inteligentes, usando esse corpo como hospedeiro. Não, não fizemos nada imoral! Esse corpo já estava morto quando o encontramos, apenas demos uma nova oportunidade de vida pra ele. Somos pacíficos. Por favor, abaixem as tochas!"
**Benefício:** Você é um fungo sapiente que habita um corpo de humanoide. Seu corpo hospedeiro segue todas as regras normais para um personagem e é considerado vivo. A qualquer momento enquanto seu corpo hospedeiro estiver vivo, ou por 24 horas após ele morrer, você pode usar uma ação principal para se mover até um humanoide morto dentro de 10 quadrados de distância do seu corpo atual e usá-lo como seu novo corpo hospedeiro, desde que a linhagem desse corpo seja jogável. Quando o fizer, seu corpo hospedeiro original morre se estava vivo. Seu novo corpo hospedeiro ganha todas as suas características exceto tamanho, traços de linhagem e outros aspectos relacionados à linhagem do seu antigo corpo hospedeiro, que você ganha do seu novo corpo hospedeiro. Quando você se muda para um novo corpo hospedeiro, você começa com 1 de Vigor e pode imediatamente gastar uma recuperação.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano de fogo 5. Além disso, você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste para interpretar as emoções ou linguagem corporal de criaturas humanoides.

### Covarde

Algumas pessoas chamam você de covarde, só por que você grita e corre do perigo. Claro, você pode não ter a ousadia natural às pessoas menos imaginativas; e claro, você sempre está imaginando as várias maneiras terríveis das quais pode morrer; mas isso te acostumou ao medo. Quando você foge de medo, você pode fugir na direção que quiser.
**Benefício:** Enquanto você está assustado, você pode se mover na direção da origem do seu medo.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que você faz um teste de resistência para encerrar a condição de Assustado, você lança o d10 duas vezes e usa o menor resultado.

### Cria Vampírica

Um vampiro mordeu você. Você não é um morto-vivo—pelo menos não por enquanto—mas sua conexão com seu vampiro progenitor enche você de desejos difíceis de controlar.
**Benefício:** Sempre que você dá um golpe simples corpo-a-corpo contra criatura adjacente, você pode fazê-lo mordendo essa criatura. Se você obtiver Grau 3 no golpe simples, você ganha Vigor Temporário igual ao dano causado. Se não for perdido antes, esse Vigor Temporário dura até o fim do seu próximo descanso.
**Inconveniência:** Enquanto você tem Vigor Temporário dessa complicação, suas presas crescem de forma visível, você recebe desvantagem em testes de Presença feitos para interagir com humanoides, e seu vampiro progenitor pode sentir a sua localização.

### Criado por Feras

Você ficou órfão ou se perdeu em um lugar remoto, e um bando de animais amigáveis (talvez primatas, ursos ou lobos) acolheu você. Voltar para a dita "civilização" foi um choque, mas você está determinado a aprender tudo o que puder sobre o seu povo.
**Benefício:** Você tem a perícia de Trato Animal do grupo de perícias interpessoais. Além disso, escolha um tipo de animais relacionado aos animais que acolheram você, como "Lobos". Você ganha vantagem em testes que usam a perícia de Trato Animal quando interage com animais desse tipo. Você também pode se comunicar com animais desse tipo como se compartilhassem um idioma, e animais desse tipo não são inicialmente hostis a você, exceto se forem forçados sobrenaturalmente.
**Inconveniência:** Você não tem uma Cultura (Veja Cultura no Capítulo de Antecedentes), mas sabe caeliano.

### Desonrado

Você é um membro desonrado de uma poderosa família ou organização, tendo sido rejeitado por seus parentes ou colegas. Aqueles que antes eram próximos a você nem lhe cumprimentam mais, quanto oferecem qualquer ajuda, até que você limpe seu nome ou tome jeito.
**Benefício:** Você ganha 1 de renome, e tem uma perícia à sua escolha dos grupos de intriga ou interpessoal.
**Inconveniência:** Qualquer pessoa que ouviu falar de você e é influenciada pelo seu renome o trata como infame. Sempre que participar de uma negociação com um NPC que termina com Interesse 2 ou menos, esse NPC faz um plano para prejudicar você pessoalmente após o final da negociação—e executa esse plano.

### Doença Primordial

Você contraiu uma terrível doença para a qual ninguém conseguiu achar cura. Você buscou um pântano primordial que era conhecido por ser milagroso ou amaldiçoado. No fim das contas, era ambos, mantendo a sua doença controlada enquanto corrompia o seu corpo com suas energias anti-naturais.
**Benefício:** Você tem imunidade à corrupção 5 e imunidade a veneno 5
**Inconveniência:** Seu número de Recuperações é permanentemente reduzido por 1.

### Em Busca da Cura

Sua terra natal foi corrompida por uma terrível maldição ou praga, e só você conseguiu escapar. Seus parentes ainda estão lá, mas em formas alteradas—como crias de vampiro, zumbis ou estátuas vivas. Dizem que a situação é desesperadora, mas você está determinado a encontrar a cura para livrar seus familiares do sofrimento.
**Benefício:** Escolha um tipo de monstro relacionado aos problemas da sua terra natal, como Vampiro, Fantasma ou Medusa. Você ganha +1 de bônus em testes de resistência às habilidades desses monstros, e trata suas características como sendo maiores em 1 para resistir a potências dessas habilidades.
**Inconveniência:** Você começou a sucumbir à maldição ou praga, e vai ter o mesmo destino de sua família se não encontrar a cura logo. Colabore com o Diretor para determinar os prazos da sua transformação, de forma que possa ser possível que ocorra durante a campanha!

### Endividado

Um negócio que você fez deu errado, ou você se envolveu com as pessoas erradas. Agora você tem que pagar uma dívida ou resgate que levariam um pequeno nobre à falência. Para quitá-la, você terá que se arriscar.
**Benefício:** Você é bom com dinheiro—por necessidade. Sempre que ganha riqueza, você ganha +1 do que o indicado.
**Inconveniência:** Sua riqueza inicial é −5. Enquanto sua riqueza é menor que 1, você pode comprar itens como se sua riqueza fosse 1, mas é frequentemente visitado por cobradores e vendedores tendem a fechar suas portas quando percebem que você está vindo.

### Enlutado

A pessoa mais importante para você—talvez um familiar, mentor ou cônjuge—foi assassinada. As únicas coisas que fazem você prosseguir são a tênue conexão que tem com o espírito dessa pessoa, e a esperança de um dia finalizar os assuntos inacabados dessa pessoa para que ela possa descansar em paz.
**Benefício:** Sempre que você não sabe o que fazer, você pode pedir ajuda ao espírito dessa pessoa. Você gasta um Vale Heroico para deixar o Diretor determinar a próxima coisa que deve fazer, dentro ou fora de combate. O Diretor escolhe o melhor plano de ação que consegue imaginar para você, mesmo que dependa de informações que você não tem. Se o Diretor não consegue imaginar um bom plano de ação, você não gasta o Vale Heroico.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a corrupção 5.

### Erupção Psíquica

Em tempos de estresse, você tem dores de cabeça. Energia psiônica se acumula em sua mente até parecer que ela vai explodir. Se você não toma cuidado, ela explode mesmo irradiando ondas psíquicas que afetam tanto seus amigos quanto seus inimigos.
**Benefício:** Você tem a seguinte habilidade heroica:

---

**Explosão Psíquica (Custo de Recurso Heroico Especial)**
_Energia psiônica explode do seu corpo com brilho iridescente._

| **Área, Psiônica** |           **Ação Principal** |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 3 Explosão**  | **🎯 Cada criatura na Área** |

**Efeito:** Usar essa habilidade custa todo os seus recursos heroicos.

**Lançamento de Poder + Seu maior valor de característica:**

- **≤11:** 1 de dano psíquico para cada recurso heroico que gastar, até o máximo igual ao seu Nível.
- **12-16:** 1 de dano psíquico para cada recurso heroico que gastar, até o máximo igual ao seu Nível + seu maior valor de característica.
- **17+:** 1 de dano psíquico para cada recurso heroico que gastar.

---

**Inconveniência:** Sempre que você fica assustado, sangrando ou enfraquecido, você precisa usar Explosão Psíquica como uma reação livre.

### Escudo Fraternal

Você foi encarregado a entregar um escudo cerimonial para seu irmão mais velho, um guerreiro célebre, por seus anos de serviço. Quando chegou na casa dele, você o encontrou morto na soleira com sua própria espada cravada nas suas costas. Para descobrir quem fez isso com ele—e o por quê—você decidiu se colocar no lugar dele. No entanto, vai demorar um pouco para igualar o legado do seu irmão.
**Benefício:** Enquanto usa o escudo às suas costas, você não pode ser flanqueado.
**Inconveniência:** Visões de seu irmão falecido te assombram à noite. Sempre que tiver um descanso, faça um teste de Intuição que não pode usar perícias. Em um Grau 1 ou Grau 2, você restabelece 1 recuperação a menos do que o normal quando termina o descanso.

### Espírito Irado

Você se irrita fácil, nunca deixando um insulto passar batido sem resposta. Durante o combate, você luta como se estivesse possuído por um espírito de ira. Independente das circunstâncias táticas, quando alguém machuca você, você se sente compelido a responder sangue com sangue.
**Benefício:** Enquanto você é provocado por uma criatura, você ganha vantagem em golpes contra essa criatura. Além disso, você pode gastar 1 recurso heroico para receber vantagem dupla.
**Inconveniência:** Durante o combate, sempre que uma criatura dá um golpe contra você e você não está provocado, você é provocado por essa criatura até o fim do seu próximo turno. Além disso, seja em conversas casuais ou quando você está envolvido em uma negociação, sempre que uma criatura insulta você, você precisa gastar uma recuperação ou é compelido a responder com um insulto.

### Estudos Avançados

De alguma forma, você obteve um caderno de um incrível mas excêntrico membro da sua classe. O conhecimento escrito nessas anotações será muito útil para aprender habilidades poderosas—se você conseguir entender o que está escrito.
**Benefício e Inconveniência**: Como atividade de descanso, você pode estudar seu caderno. Faça um teste usando seu maior valor de característica:

- **≤11:** Você invoca um demônio hostil do seu Nível ou menor que ataca você no final do descanso. O demônio age primeiro em combate, independente dos traços e habilidades de qualquer criatura envolvida no combate.
- **12-16:** Você não aprende nada e perde seu tempo.
- **17+:** Você aprende uma habilidade heroica adicional da sua Classe para a qual está qualificado. Você pode usar essa habilidade até terminar um novo descanso.

### Evanescéria

Você contraiu uma doença mágica rara chamada Evanescéria. De tempos em tempos, você não se sente a mesma pessoa de sempre—na verdade, não se sente pessoa nenhuma. Você simplesmente... desaparece, e depois retorna sem lembranças da sua ausência.
**Benefício:** No começo de qualquer ronda de combate, você pode tentar se ausentar da realidade lançando um d10. Em um resultado de 6 ou mais, você desaparece e reaparece no espaço que deixou ou no espaço desocupado mais próximo à sua escolha quando começa seu turno. Você não pode tentar se ausentar novamente até conquistar 1 ou mais vitórias.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que começa uma atividade de descanso, lance 2d10. Se você lançar um 1 em qualquer dado, você inadvertidamente se ausenta da realidade, reaparecendo ao fim do descanso. Você ganha os benefícios do descanso mas não realiza a atividade de descanso.

### Exilado

Seja por ser um criminoso condenado, um nobre despojado de seu título, ou uma pessoa que fez inimigos demais, você foi mandado embora da sua terra natal para nunca mais voltar. Pelo menos não até que seja forte o suficiente para corrigir as coisas.
**Benefício:** Você conhece um idioma extante da sua escolha (Veja Idiomas em Orden no Capítulo de Antecedentes).
**Inconveniência:** Se qualquer NPC da sua terra natal reconhece você, tanto na sua terra natal quanto fora dela, eles tentam te prejudicar, à discrição do Diretor.

### Ficando Velho Demais Pra Isso

Você era um herói renomado, mas passou os últimos anos vivendo em paz e tranquilidade. Agora você está deixando a aposentadoria para uma última jornada. Sua capacidade de lutar pode ter atrofiado ao ponto de não ser mais forte que um aventureiro novato inexperiente, no entanto, ainda lembra de algum de seus velhos truques.
**Benefício:** No seu turno, você pode escolher uma habilidade heroica que você poderia aprender se tivesse 1 Nível a mais. Desde que você preencha os demais pré-requisitos e possa gastar quaisquer recursos heroicos necessários, você pode usar essa habilidade. Depois de usar esse benefício, você não pode fazê-lo novamente até conquistar duas ou mais vitórias.
**Inconveniência:** Enquanto você está ofegante, você sofre uma penalidade de −2 de velocidade.

### Fogo e Caos

Um grande monstro cuspidor de fogo reduziu a sua casa a cinzas. Enquanto tudo em sua volta era consumido, você de alguma forma resistiu ao incêndio, e o seu corpo se adaptou para ignorar os efeitos das chamas.
**Benefício:** Você tem imunidade a fogo 5.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a frio 5.

### Fora-da-Lei

Você pode ser um bandido comum ou um revolucionário idealista, mas em todo o caso, as autoridades não aprovam as suas atitudes. Você tem se mantido um passo à frente da lei até agora, mas enquanto não limpa o seu nome, você precisa se cuidar.
**Benefício:** Você ganha 1 renome.
**Inconveniência:** Oficiais da lei e caçadores de recompensas que reconhecem você tentam te prender.

### Forma Animal

Por causa de um acidente mágico, você se fundiu com um pequeno animal inofensivo. Você se transforma nesse quando é conveniente—e ocasionalmente quando não é.
**Benefício:** Com uma manobra, você toma a forma de um animal específico de tamanho 1PP. Você mantém todas as suas características exceto o seu tamanho, mas não pode falar ou usar ações, e as únicas manobras que pode usar são Escapar Agarrão, Esconder-se, e Levantar. Dependendo do animal no qual se torna, você pode ser capaz de Escavar ou Voar, ou de automaticamente Escalar ou Nadar toda a sua velocidade quando se move. Se sua forma animal não provê um movimento adicional, você ganha +2 de bônus de velocidade. A não ser que use esse benefício novamente, você retorna a sua forma verdadeira no início do seu próximo turno.
**Inconveniência:** No começo de qualquer turno enquanto você está ofegante, o Diretor pode gastar 1 de Malícia para forçar você a tomar sua forma animal. Caso o Diretor faça isso, ele não pode fazê-lo novamente até que você tenha terminado um descanso.

### Fugitivo

Para seu constrangimento, não houve mau presságio sobre o seu nascimento e seus armários não contém esqueletos. Você é uma pessoa normal de uma família trabalhadora. Eles esperavam que você desse continuidade ao negócio da família—mas você não pode se conformar com um emprego entediante enquanto a aventura lhe chama! Por isso você fugiu.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de criação.
**Inconveniência:** Membros de sua família estão procurando por você, pretendendo arrastar você pra casa—e você nunca teve coragem para confrontá-los.

### Gêmeo Secreto

Você tem um gêmeo idêntico—seja um irmão ou alguém que se parece tanto com você que ninguém perceberia a diferença. Seu gêmeo secreto tinha uma vida que você invejava, ou talvez tinha obrigações que não poderia deixar de realizar. Por isso, quando ele desapareceu, você interferiu e o substituiu. A maioria das pessoas nem percebeu.
**Benefício:** Você tem um adereço de 1º escalão à sua escolha que era um tesouro característico do seu gêmeo, tendo o nome ou símbolo dele escrito, costurado ou estampado nele.
**Inconveniência:** Seu gêmeo desapareceu por que alguém o queria morto. Sempre que você termina um descanso, lance um d10. Em um resultado de 1 ou 2, o Diretor pode decidir que o seu passado o alcança de alguma forma—um assassino rastreando o seu gêmeo, alguém que sabe da sua verdadeira identidade e ameaça revelá-la, etc...

### Guarda

Seu amor de infância era da realeza, e vocês mantiveram contato ao longo dos anos. Quando essa pessoa faleceu, você jurou dedicar sua vida para ser um exemplo para o filho dessa pessoa, o aconselhando para ser um monarca benevolente.
**Benefício:** Você sabe como falar com monarcas, aristocratas e outros líderes abastados. Quando interage com qualquer NPC desse tipo durante uma negociação, a Paciência dele aumenta em 1 (ao máximo de 5).
**Inconveniência:** Seu pupilo real pode ser um fardo. Sempre que você começa um descanso, lance um d10. Em um resultado de 1, seu pupilo o contata e pede sua ajuda durante o descanso, fazendo com que gaste seu tempo o ajudando em vez de realizar uma atividade de descanso.

### Guerra dos Assassinos

Estar no lugar errado na hora errada o deixou no meio de um conflito entre duas guildas de assassinos em guerra. Seja por escolha ou acidente, você acabou ajudando uma facção em detrimento da outra.
**Benefício:** Tendo ganho o favor da facção que ajudou, você pode pedir favores deles três vezes. Se o favor é plausível e a facção tem o poder de concedê-lo, seus membros o realizam sem fazer perguntas.
**Inconveniência:** A facção que prejudicou odeia você, e seus membros adorariam ver você pagar pela transgressão.

### Habitante do Esgoto

Por pobreza ou por estar em fuga, você passou seus anos formativos vivendo nos esgotos de uma grande cidade. Lá, você aprendeu lições que são valiosas, ainda que o miasma do esgoto tenha prejudicado permanentemente a sua saúde.
**Benefício:** Você pode automaticamente Escalar ou Nadar (à sua escolha) toda a sua velocidade quando se move, e você nunca se perde no subterrâneo. Além disso, enquanto estiver em cidades com esgotos, você e seus companheiros podem se mover de um lugar para o outro sem serem detectados, à discrição do Diretor.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a veneno 5.

### Herança Estranha

Seus irmãos herdaram dinheiro ou terras, mas você recebeu um estranho, aparentemente inútil adereço—junto com o conselho de que você talvez não era talhado para uma vida pacífica normal.
**Benefício:** Você tem um adereço de 2º escalão aparentemente inoperante à escolha do Diretor. (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas). Esse adereço só funciona quando o total do seu Nível somado às suas vitórias é igual ou maior que 5. Você não sabe o que o adereço faz até a primeira vez em que ele se torna operacional.
**Inconveniência:** Não tendo recebido mais nada de herança, você acumulou dívidas. Na primeira vez que sua riqueza excede 1, você perde 1 de riqueza.

### Hospedeiro Elemental

Quando um mago malvado ameaçou alguém que você ama, você bloqueou a invocação de uma criatura elemental pelo seu oponente, absorvendo sua magia em seu corpo. Você agora contém o poder desse elemental—que não está muito feliz com isso.
**Benefício:** Você ganha +3 de bônus de Vigor no Nível 1, e novamente nos Níveis 4, 7 e 10.
**Inconveniência:** Enquanto está morrendo, o elemental que absorveu toma controle do seu corpo. O elemental almeja destruição, fazendo com que você ataque a criatura mais próxima que percebe, ignorando suas intenções ou a sua segurança. Se você não fizer o máximo para satisfazer a raiva do elemental, o Diretor pode temporariamente controlar o seu herói.

### Ideal Ardente

Um espírito além da sua compreensão instilou em você um propósito especial, escolhendo você como guardião de um local, causa ou filosofia. A chama que agora queima na sua alma pode queimar também os seus inimigos—ou você mesmo se ficar aquém das expectativas.
**Benefício:** Enquanto luta pelo seu propósito especial, sempre que você obtém Grau 3 com uma habilidade que causa dano, a habilidade causa dano adicional igual ao seu maior valor de característica.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que o Diretor determina que você agiu contra o seu propósito ou não conseguiu manter os altos padrões associados a ele, você sofre dano de fogo igual a 5 + o seu Nível. Esse dano não pode ser reduzido de nenhuma maneira.

### Identidade Secreta

Você é secretamente importante—mas não é seguro revelar a sua identidade verdadeira. Talvez você testemunhou um crime ou é membro de uma família real perseguida por um usurpador. Até que não haja risco de ser perseguido, você se disfarça como um mero aventureiro.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de intriga. Além disso, você pode reassumir a sua identidade verdadeira temporariamente. Enquanto estiver usando sua identidade verdadeira, seu renome e riqueza são tratadas como sendo 2 a mais que o normal. E você pode ganhar benefícios adicionais à discrição do Diretor.
**Inconveniência:** Cada vez que você reassume sua identidade verdadeira enquanto ainda é procurado, há uma chance de 20%, cumulativa a cada dia, de você ser encontrado por seus inimigos. Essa chance se reinicia quando você reassume a sua identidade secreta por 1 dia.

### Imortal Caído

Você era uma criatura imortal, dispensando justiça e cumprindo as ordens dos deuses. Agora, seja por punição ou recompensa, você foi ordenado a deixar sua natureza de lado e se tornar mortal. Seus anos restantes serão breves, mas viver ao lado dos demais mortais dá um novo propósito à sua vida.
**Benefício:** Você tem a perícia Religião do grupo de perícias de conhecimento. Além disso, sempre que usa uma habilidade que causa dano sem tipo, pode escolher causar dano sagrado com essa habilidade .
**Inconveniência:** Você nunca terá o conforto dos mortais com inverdades. Qualquer teste que você faça para enganar outra criatura recebe desvantagem.

### Incompreendido

Sua aparência o marca como parte de um grupo que é temido. Você pode ser uma pessoa gentil, mas geralmente não lhe dão a oportunidade de prová-lo. Não é a toa que você geralmente usa capuz.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** Quando revela sua aparência para criaturas que não conhecem você, você ganha vantagem em qualquer teste para Gabar-se ou Intimidar essas criaturas, porém recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste para Flertar com, Liderar ou Persuadir essas criaturas.

### Interesse Obsessivo

Desde criança, você foi obcecado com um certo tema. Durante suas viagens, você gasta seu tempo livre estudando informações sobre essa obsessão. Você pode não ser o maior especialista do mundo nesse tema, mas as pessoas deveriam respeitar sua opinião a respeito dele.
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de conhecimento e pode usar o projeto _Estudar_ (Veja abaixo) até três vezes para essa perícia. Cada vez que sua o projeto, deve usar uma nova origem de projeto, e o objetivo de projeto aumenta. (Veja o Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre)
**Inconveniência:** Você não consegue imaginar estar errado sobre o tema da sua obsessão. Sempre que fizer um teste para relembrar de conhecimento usando a perícia escondida, o Diretor faz o teste em segredo. Em vez de informar se você está certo ou errado, ele provê informações corretas se você obteve sucesso, ou informações falsas se você falhou no teste.

**_ESTUDAR_**
**Item Pré-requisito:** Nenhum
**Origem do Projeto:** Uma fonte significativa de informações sobre o tema da sua obsessão, como uma grande biblioteca ou sábio renomado.
**Característica do Lançamento de Projeto:** Razão
**Objetivo de Projeto:** 120, 150, 180
Cada vez que complete esse projeto, seu conhecimento da disciplina escolhida aumenta, e o bônus para testes com a Perícia escolhida aumentam em +1.

### Juramento de Dever

Você prestou juramento para uma organização. Essa organização é o seu apoio, e enquanto a sua fé nela permanecer inabalada, você é inamovível.
**Benefício:** Você ganha +1 de bônus de estabilidade.
**Inconveniência:** Se você for forçado a desobedecer as ordens da sua organização, sua estabilidade se torna 0 até suas dúvidas sobre ela serem resolvidas ou encontrar uma nova organização para prestar juramento.

### Juramento de Honestidade

Você foi criado com um rígido padrão de comportamento. Você não pode mentir.
**Benefício:** Se uma criatura tem Nível inferior ao seu, você automaticamente sabe quando ela está mentindo, ainda que não saiba necessariamente qual é a verdade por trás dessa mentira. Além disso, você recebe vantagem dupla em qualquer teste feito para persuadir uma criatura de um fato específico.
**Inconveniência:** Quando você mente, sua honra é manchada e você perde o benefício dessa complicação. Além disso, você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste que use uma perícia do grupo de perícias interpessoais. Você só pode se livrar dessa desvantagem e recuperar o benefício dessa complicação por meio de penitência, como pedindo perdão para a criatura para quem mentiu.

### Legado Destruído

Você herdou um poderoso tesouro sobrenatural que está na sua família a gerações. Só tem um probleminha: o tesouro está quebrado. Algum ancestral seu o destruiu salvando o mundo, ou talvez ele tropeçou e o esmagou contra uma rocha. De qualquer forma, você que precisa consertá-lo.
**Benefício:** Você sabe um idioma à sua escolha. Além disso, você tem um Tesouro com Nível à sua escolha (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas).
**Inconveniência:** O Tesouro com Nível escolhido está quebrado e completamente desativado. Reparar o tesouro requer que você complete o projeto de Criar Tesouro dele. O objetivo de projeto é a metade do que normalmente precisaria para criar tal item, e você já tem a origem de projeto necessária. Você precisa procurar seus itens pré-requisitos.

### Leve Caso de Licantropia

Talvez você foi mordido quando criança, ou talvez seja uma maldição de família. De qualquer forma, você tem uma enfermidade que prefere não discutir em público, para evitar as tochas e ancinhos.
**Benefício:** Sempre que você deixa uma criatura não-lacaia ofegante ou mata uma criatura não-lacaia, você ganha 1 impulso.
**Inconveniência:** No começo de cada um dos seus turnos, se você tem cinco ou mais impulsos—ou um ou mais impulsos à luz da lua—você perde todos os impulsos e se torna um híbrido canino até o fim do seu turno. Enquanto nessa forma, você continua com suas estatísticas usuais, mas você tem que dar um golpe simples corpo-a-corpo contra a criatura mais próxima se puder. Você pode ajustar-se até a sua velocidade na direção da criatura se necessário. Se aliados e inimigos estão à mesma distância, você ataca um aliado.
**Especial:** Você não pode escolher essa complicação se for uma Fúria com o aspecto primordial Tempestuosa.

### Ligado a um Artefacto

Um poderoso artefacto se ligou a você, ainda que você não saiba se está destinado a empunhá-lo ou destruí-lo. Nesse momento, você não é poderoso o suficiente para usá-lo, ainda que um dia possa ser. Por enquanto, o artefacto não faz efeito além de criar problemas para você.
**Benefício:** Escolha um artefacto (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas). Na primeira vez em um encontro em que você é reduzido a 0 de Vigor contra a sua vontade, o artefacto aparece na sua posse. Ele desaparece no fim do seu próximo turno, quando você se beneficia de alguma de suas propriedades ou quando você tiver mais de 0 de Vigor, o que ocorrer primeiro.
**Inconveniência:** Cada vez que o artefacto aparece, você perde uma recuperação. Se você não tem mais recuperações, em vez disso você sofre 1d10 de dano, que não pode ser reduzido de nenhuma maneira.

### Maldição da Cautela

Quando era jovem, você fez algo arriscado sem pensar e colocou uma bruxa em risco ou custou a ela algo importante. A bruxa amaldiçoou você para que sempre seja paciente, forçando você a ser cauteloso e minucioso—mesmo em detrimento próprio. A maldição já salvou você de alguns perigos, mas não conseguir fugir de outros pode ser a sua ruína caso não consiga se livrar dela.
**Benefício:** Até que termine o seu turno em uma ronda de combate, qualquer golpe contra você recebe desvantagem.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem −1 de penalidade de velocidade.

### Maldição da Imortalidade

Desde que tem lembrança, você não envelhece. Você simplesmente tem se aventurado era após era. No entanto, sua memória de eventos do passado—mesmo os nos quais você estava envolvido—é meio turva. Aparentemente a sua memória não é tão duradoura quanto você.
**Benefício:** Você não envelhece. Além disso, sempre que você morre, em vez disso você entra em um estado de animação suspensa indistinguível da morte. Se o seu corpo não for destruído quando você morrer ou enquanto está nesse estado, você retorna à vida depois de 12 horas e recupera Vigor igual ao seu valor de recuperação.
**Inconveniência:** Você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para relembrar de conhecimento.

### Maldição da Pobreza

Um adivinho previu que você teria uma longa vida, mas também te contou que nunca seria rico. Porém, você está determinado a provar o contrário. Você vai enriquecer ou morrer tentando!
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** Sempre que você descansa enquanto sua riqueza é maior que 1, algum evento improvável ocorre que causa o desaparecimento da maior parte do seu dinheiro—incluindo dinheiro que você escondeu, emprestou ou doou. Sua riqueza é reduzida para 1. Para cada ponto de riqueza que perdeu dessa forma, seu número de recuperações aumenta em 1. Suas recuperações voltam à quantidade normal na primeira vez que descansar com menos recuperações que o seu máximo.

### Maldição de Pedra

Quando criança, você encontrou uma criatura que petrifica pessoas, como um basilisco ou medusa. Você escapou meio petrificado, evitando o destino de virar uma estátua.
**Benefício:** Você tem +1 de bônus de estabilidade. Além disso, você pode usar uma manobra livra para fazer com que seu corpo, equipamento e qualquer item que carregue pareçam ser de pedra, de forma que você se pareça com uma estátua mundana enquanto permanecer imóvel.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano sônico 5. Além disso, enquanto você estiver ofegante, você está atordoado.

### Maldição do Castigo

Por ignorância, medo, despeito ou egoísmo, você se negou a ajudar uma pessoa necessitada. Para lhe ensinar uma lição, uma divindade ofereceu a você algo que parecia um bênção—poderes adicionais para que se curasse em tempos difíceis, porém se você exagerasse, haveriam consequências severas. Você aceitou o acordo e recebeu a bênção e a maldição.
**Benefício:** Você tem 1 recuperação adicional.
**Inconveniência:** Quando você não tem mais recuperações, você está morrendo, independente do seu Vigor atual.

### Maldição do Infortúnio

Você não deveria ter irritado aquele mago! Talvez ele mereceu a sua ira, ou talvez você só estava sendo um valentão. De qualquer forma, ele te amaldiçoou antes de fugir da cidade. Agora, em momentos de pressão que exigem perícia, você tem uma tendência a ceder à pressão, cair ou vacilar dramaticamente e levar todo mundo com você.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** Sempre que você faz um teste durante um combate e incorre uma consequência, você ignora essa consequência. Em vez dela, você e cada aliado adjacente são derrubados.

### Médium

Você consegue perceber fantasmas e espíritos que outros não sentem. Essas entidades sobrenaturais constantemente sussurram segredos inquietantes na sua mente—quando não estão tentando te matar.
**Benefício e Inconveniência:** Mortos-vivos incorpóreos dentro de 10 quadrados de distância podem se comunicar telepaticamente com você. Além disso, você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Contactar Espíritos**
_Os mortos sem descanso falam com você._

| **Magia**         |    Ação Principal |
| ----------------- | ----------------: |
| **📏 Personagem** | **🎯 Personagem** |

**Lançamento de Poder + Intuição ou Presença:**

- **≤11:** Você sofre dano de corrupção igual a 5 + seu Nível.
- **12-16:** O espírito de alguém falecido que você conhece fala com você, desde que esteja no mesmo mundo que você. Você sabe como ele morreu e pode fazer uma pergunta, que eles podem responder verdadeiramente ou não. O espírito sabe tudo o que sabia em vida, e tem consciência de eventos que aconteceram nas imediações após a sua morte.
- **17+:** Igual ao Grau 2, mas você pode fazer três perguntas.

**Efeito:** Se quaisquer criaturas sapientes morreram nas redondezas dentro das últimas 24
horas, você recebem desvantagem dupla no lançamento de poder dessa habilidade se qualquer dessas criaturas era hostil a você, ou vantagem dupla se qualquer delas era amigável com você. Quando você usa essa habilidade, você não pode fazê-lo novamente até conquistar 1 ou mais vitórias.

---

### Mentor Corrupto

Seu mentor ensinou a você tudo o que sabe e você confiava nele completamente—até ele ignorar suas ordens, traindo você ou a organização da qual vocês faziam parte. O paradeiro e atividades atuais dele são desconhecidos, ainda que boatos perturbadores sejam disseminados ocasionalmente. Pior ainda, como seu antigo pupilo, você também está sob suspeita.
**Benefício:** Você conhece a manobra Corromper Espírito, ensinada pelo seu mentor. (Em retrospecto, isso deveria ter despertado suspeitas.)

---

**Corromper Espírito**
_Você descobriu os segredos sinistros da dor._

| **Magia**         |           Manobra |
| ----------------- | ----------------: |
| **📏 Personagem** | **🎯 Personagem** |

**Efeito:** Até o fim do seu turno, sempre que você usa uma habilidade heroica que causa dano contra um único alvo, você pode enfraquecer a vitalidade daquele alvo. A habilidade causa dano de corrupção adicional igual ao seu maior valor de característica.

---

**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano sagrado 1. Cada vez que usa "Corromper Espírito", sua fraqueza a dano sagrado aumenta em 1, ao máximo igual ao seu valor de recuperação. Sempre que você sofre dano sagrado, essa fraqueza volta a ser 1.

### Mestre Cuca

Antes de ser herói, você era _chef_—e quando você se aposentar, você tem grandes planos para seu próximo restaurante ou taverna. Por enquanto, você está atento para ingredientes raros que apenas um aventureiro errante pode encontrar. Afinal, é a comida que move o mundo.
**Benefício:** Você tem a perícia Culinária do grupo de perícias de criação. Além disso, sempre que você termina um descanso ou acorda de uma noite de sono, você pode passar 1 hora ininterrupta para preparar uma refeição excelente para até 10 criaturas, desde que você tenha ingredientes e utensílios de cozinha. Uma vez durante as próximas 24 horas, cada criatura que comeu a refeição pode ganhar o benefício de gastar uma recuperação sem gastar uma recuperação.
**Inconveniência:** Na primeira vez em cada dia que você come comida que não preparou, você perde 2 recuperações.

### Mordomo Intrometido

Você não sabe o que fez para merecer isso, mas por alguma razão sua família o deixou com um antigo e extremamente irritante servo de confiança. Ele é extremamente competente, claro, mas por vezes parece esquecer quem está no comando.
**Benefício:** Você tem um militante adicional a quaisquer seguidores que adquira por renome ou outros meios. Como regra, você só pode ter um militante em seu serviço por vez. (Veja Renome no Capítulo de Recompensas e Militantes em _Draw Steel: Monstros_).
**Inconveniência:** Fora de combate, seu militante está sob o controle do Diretor. O militante por vezes age sem você pedir—sempre de acordo com seus interesses, mas geralmente de formas inconvenientes e embaraçosas.

### Mundano

Você é completamente mundano. Quando usa habilidades mágicas, ou quando elas são usadas contra você, elas não funcionam bem. Até tesouros mágicos falham em sua presença.
**Benefício:** Você tem imunidade a dano de corrupção, sagrado e psíquico igual ao seu Nível.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que carrega mais de três tesouros mágicos, você recebe desvantagem em lançamentos de poder.

### Mutilado por Gnolls

Quando criança, você sobreviveu um ataque de gnolls. Porém, esse ataque o deixou com uma cicatriz profunda e o ocasional surto de sede de sangue.
**Benefício:** Sempre que um aliado dentro de 5 quadrados de distância é reduzido a 0 de Vigor, você pode usar uma reação para se mover até a sua velocidade e dar um golpe simples.
**Inconveniência:** Enquanto está atordoado, se você começar seu turno adjacente a uma ou mais criaturas, você deve usar sua ação principal para dar um golpe simples corpo-a-corpo contra uma criatura adjacente.
**Especial:** Você não pode escolher essa complicação se não puder ficar atordoado.

### Nascido nas Sombras

Você nasceu numa terra sombria governada pela Rainha das Sombras, e a escuridão penetrou em seus ossos. (Veja A Miríade de Mundos da Timescape no Capítulo O Básico.)
**Benefício:** Sempre que você inicia seu turno com encobrimento, você ganha 1 impulso.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano sagrado 5.

### Náufrago

Você foi o único sobrevivente de um naufrágio que o deixou ilhado em um local remoto e inóspito por vários anos. Sua luta pela sobrevivência nessa ilha concedeu a você entendimento do mundo natural, mas o afastou da pessoa que era.
**Benefício:** Você tem duas perícias à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de exploração.
**Inconveniência:** Você esqueceu um idioma que sabia, à sua escolha.

### O Escolhido

Talvez as estrelas marcaram você quando nasceu, ou talvez seu nome apareça em uma antiga profecia. De qualquer forma, um culto sinistro decidiu que você é importante para os planos deles—ainda que você não aprove do destino que esses planos preveem para você.
**Benefício:** Você tem 3 pontos de destino. Sempre que gastar o recurso heroico da sua classe, você pode gastar 1 ou mais pontos de destino em vez dele. Cada vez que você conquista uma vitória, você recupera 1 ponto de destino.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que você gastar 1 ou mais pontos de destino, você sofre 1d10 de dano psíquico que não pode ser reduzido de nenhuma maneira, e o culto que o procura descobre a sua localização.

### Oficial Exonerado

Você foi treinado como oficial, mas não está mais em serviço. Independente de ter fugido de uma batalha, sido exonerado desonrosamente, ou desertado de um exército do mal, você agora segue o seu próprio caminho no mundo—ainda que não deixe para trás o seu treinamento militar.
**Benefício:** Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Dar Ordem**
_“É agir ou morrer, pessoal.”_

| **À Distância **      | **Ação Principal** |
| --------------------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 À Distância 10** |   **🎯 Um aliado** |

**Efeito:** O alvo pode usar uma reação para realizar uma ação principal, manobra ou ação de movimento.
**Especial:** Se você tem a habilidade Ataque Agora! dos Táticos, o alvo pode usar uma reação livre em vez de uma reação para ganhar o benefício dessa habilidade.

---

**Inconveniência:** Em vez de atrair seguidores com 3, 6, 9 e 12 de renome, você pode atrair seguidores apenas quando seu renome alcançar 4, 8, 12 e 16. (Veja Renome no Capítulo de Recompensas)

### Parente Famoso

Claro, você é um jovem herói promissor—mas as pessoas sempre perguntam sobre o seu parente famoso. Você igualará ou ultrapassará os feitos do seu parente, ou você sempre viverá à sua sombra?
**Benefício:** Você tem uma peça de joalheria mágica, como um anel sinete. Com uma manobra, você pode usar esse item para invocar o seu parente para que o ajude. Seu parente começa com 10 de renome, mas suas demais características são iguais às suas. Ele ganha vantagem em lançamentos de poder, mas não se beneficiam de qualquer dos seus tesouros. Seu parente faz o melhor que pode para ajudá-lo a superar a situação perigosa atual, desaparecendo quando a situação é resolvida ou depois de 1 hora. Após invocar o seu parente, você não pode fazê-lo até ganhar um Nível.
**inconveniência:** Você não ganha vitórias de encontros de combate ou outros desafios para os quais o seu parente estava presente. Além disso, cada vez que invoca o seu parente, na próxima vez que você ganhar renome, quem ganha renome é o seu parente.

### Pele de Árvore

Você estava morrendo em uma silva, desmaiando pela fome ou por suas feridas. Quando acordou, percebeu que um grupo de Elementalistas Verdes havia salvado sua vida revestindo o seu corpo com a casca de uma árvore regenerativa.
**Benefício:** Seu valor de recuperação aumenta por um valor igual ao seu maior valor de característica.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a fogo 5.

---

### Perdeu a Cabeça

Um bredbeddle roubou sua cabeça! Geralmente, ser decapitado por um gigante mágico é fatal (Veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_), mas sua habilidade psiônica latente permitiu que sobrevivesse apesar dessa decapitação.
**Benefício:** Você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Compartilhar Cabeça**
_Você não tem cabeça, mas pode pegar outra emprestada psionicamente._

| **Psiônica, À Distância** |                  **Manobra** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 À Distância 10**     | **🎯 Uma criatura disposta** |

**Efeito:** Você pode ver, ouvir e sentir cheiros como se estivesse no espaço do alvo. Além disso, você pode pegar emprestado a boca do alvo para falar quando quiser, falando com a sua própria voz. Esse efeito termina quando você usa Compartilhar Cabeça em um alvo diferente, quando o alvo se move mais do que 10 quadrados de distância de você, ou quando o alvo não está mais disposto a compartilhar a cabeça com você.

---

**Inconveniência:** Não tendo cabeça, você não consegue ver, ouvir, sentir cheiros ou sabores e verbalizar, exceto usando a habilidade Compartilhar Cabeça. Além disso, você não pode usar equipamentos que exigem uma cabeça, como chapéus ou capacetes.

### Perdido no Tempo

Num passado distante, um cataclismo assolou sua cidade. Você não morreu, mas um acidente arcano fez com que ficasse suspenso no tempo até agora. Sozinho, você deve andar pelo mundo com a cabeça cheia de memórias obsoletas e—e alguns segredos antigos.
**Benefício:** Escolha um tipo de dano entre Ácido, Frio, Corrupção, Fogo, Sagrado, Elétrico, Veneno, Psíquico ou Sônico. Sempre que usa uma habilidade clássica, você pode fazer essa habilidade causar esse tipo de dano em vez do dano que normalmente causa.
**Inconveniência:** Você automaticamente falha qualquer teste feito para relembrar de informações de um período durante o qual você estava suspenso no tempo.

### Pés no Chão

Quando criança, seu assentamento estava em perigo e você invocou a terra pedindo ajuda. Esse pedido foi respondido por uma invocação de paredes protetoras de pedra e poeira, e desde então, você sente a presença da terra como amiga e protetora.
**Benefício:** Você tem o recurso de especialização de Elementalista de Nível 1 "Motivar Terra" (Veja Capítulo de Classes). Se você já tem esse recurso por qualquer motivo, a habilidade Motivar Terra se torna uma habilidade à distância para você, com uma distância de 5.
**Inconveniência:** Você atrai eletricidade. Sempre que qualquer criatura dentro de 2
quadrados de distância sofre dano elétrico, você sofre 5 de dano elétrico que não pode reduzir de nenhuma maneira.

### Pirata

Você tem um passado de pirataria (e talvez um presente e futuro de pirataria também). Ainda que não seja conhecido em terra firma, outros piratas conseguem reconhecer um dos seus.
**Benefício:** Quando interage com piratas ou caçadores de piratas, você considera o seu renome como 2 maior que o normal. Além disso, você tem uma parte de um mapa pirata, e alguns piratas em diferentes localizações tem as demais partes. Com todas as partes, você saberia a localização de um fabuloso tesouro pirata.
**Inconveniência:** Os piratas com as outras partes adorariam botar as mãos na sua parte, e não se importariam em matá-lo por ela. Além disso, dizem que o tesouro pirata é amaldiçoado ou assombrado.

### Pouso Forçado

Você viajava as estrelas com sua nave. Porém, um confronto com um pirata (ou caçador de piratas) o deixou encalhado nesse mundo atrasado. Você está determinado a ganhar a vida aqui—ao menos até conseguir uma carona para outro lugar.
**Benefício:** Você tem a perícia Timescape do grupo de perícias de conhecimento. Além disso, você tem um anel de poder que pode ativar ou desativar com uma manobra. Quando ativa o anel de poder, escolha um tipo de energia entre Frio, Fogo, Elétrico ou Sônico. Até você desativar o anel de poder, suas habilidades que causam dano causam esse tipo de dano.
**Inconveniência:** Você recebe desvantagem em qualquer teste feito para saber qualquer coisa relacionado ao mundo onde pousou.

### Pregador

Quando jovem, você quase morreu num acidente ou ataque, mas uma visão de um deus ou santo lhe mostrou o caminho para a sua salvação e das pessoas que ama. Esse evento o levou à igreja e deu a você uma forte convicção em uma religião ou causa específica—e você não pode esperar para espalhar a boa nova para outras pessoas.
**Benefício:** Como atividade de descanso, você pode tentar converter membros de uma comunidade à sua causa. Faça um teste de Presença com a dificuldade determinada pelo Diretor baseada na receptividade da comunidade às suas ideias. Caso obtenha sucesso, você converte um NPC em um seguidor (Veja Renome no Capítulo de Recompensas), que você ganha adicionalmente a quaisquer seguidores que adquira por renome ou outros meios. O Diretor determina o tipo de seguidor. Após converter um NPC em seguidor dessa forma, você não pode usar esse benefício novamente até que ganhe um Nível.
**Inconveniência:** Se falhar na sua tentativa de conversão, um dos seus seguidores atuais à escolha do Diretor (tanto os ganhos por essa complicação, quanto por renome ou outros meios) deixa você, com sua fé em você abalada. Se você não tem seguidores, o seu renome é reduzido por 1. Se você precisa reduzir o seu renome e ele já é 0, você não ganha benefícios do descanso durante o qual tentou converter o NPC.

### Preso Injustamente

Você passou muitos anos preso por um crime que não cometeu. Durante as longas horas de confinamento, você aprimorou suas perícias e recitou os nomes dos responsáveis pela sua prisão. Um dia você vai se vingar.
**Benefício:** Você tem duas perícias à sua escolha, nenhuma das quais pode ser do grupo de perícias interpessoais.
**Inconveniência:** Sua saúde sofreu na prisão. Sempre que você está ofegante, você tem um surto de tosse que impossibilita que se esconda ou se esgueire.

### Prisioneiro dos Synlirii

Você foi capturado pelos seres psiônicos conhecidos como falantes sem voz (Veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_). Você escapou, mas não pode escapar do sentimento que persiste desde então no fundo da sua mente—o sentimento de ser observado.
**Benefício:** Você pode telepaticamente se comunicar com qualquer criatura dentro de 10 quadrados de distância de você se compartilhar um idioma com ela e vocês souberem um do outro. Uma criatura com a qual se comunica dessa maneira pode responder telepaticamente se quiser.
**Inconveniência:** Qualquer falante sem voz dentro de 1 milha(1,6km) sabe a sua localização, e pode ouvir secretamente e entender as suas conversas telepáticas.

### Prometido

Seus pais fizeram um acordo, e como parte desse acordo você deveria se casar com alguém—ou alguma coisa—que não escolheu. Porém, ninguém vai lhe dizer o que fazer! Eles vão se decepcionar em saber que você fugiu pra se tornar um aventureiro poderoso.
**Benefício:** Você escapou com um dote—um adereço de 1º escalão à sua escolha (Veja Tesouros no Capítulo de Recompensas).
**Inconveniência:** Todos que descobrem que você fugiu do compromisso pensam mal de você e espalham boatos desagradáveis a seu respeito. Seu renome não pode ser maior que o seu Nível − 1.

### Refugiado

Um exército hostil—talvez as forças de Ajax, o Santo de Ferro—conquistaram a sua terra natal. Sua família escapou, mas não pode retornar para casa até que seus opressores sejam derrotados de uma vez por todas.
**Benefício:** Quando sua família fugiu de sua terra natal, eles deixaram seus bens mais valiosos para trás. Colabore com o Diretor para determinar se esse bem é um adereço, tesouro com nível, vários pontos de riqueza, origem de projeto para criar um tesouro, ou algo assim. Esse bem está na posse dos invasores, mas pode ser recuperado conforme o Diretor determinar.
**Inconveniência:** A facção que invadiu a sua terra natal quer você capturado ou morto. Qualquer dos seus agentes ou simpatizantes tentam machucar você se o reconhecerem, conforme o Diretor determina.

### Renascido nas Águas

Você quase perdeu a vida no mar, até ouvir uma voz. Alguém—ou algo—na água o chamou, falando que nadasse. O oceano subitamente não era mais seu túmulo, era como um patrono, lhe concedendo uma fração do seu poder. Porém, você não sabe para qual propósito.
**Benefício:** Você pode automaticamente nadar toda a sua velocidade quando se move, e pode respirar debaixo d'água. Além disso, você tem a seguinte habilidade:

---

**Chama-Onda**
_Você invoca uma onda de água para atingir um oponente._

| **Magia, À Distância, Golpe** |           ** Ação Principal** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 À Distância 10**         | **🎯 Uma criatura ou objeto** |

**Lançamento de Poder + Seu maior valor de característica:**

- **≤11:** 2 de dano; Empurrar ou Puxar 1
- **12-16:** 5 de dano; Empurrar ou Puxar 2
- **17+:** 7 de dano; Empurrar ou Puxar 3

**Efeito:** Você pode escolher não causar dano com essa habilidade.

---

**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a dano elétrico 5. Além disso, o oceano ou uma criatura que ele envie para procurá-lo pode lhe dar uma missão. Se você não cumprir o pedido do oceano, ele pode temporariamente negar os benefícios dessa complicação—incluindo respirar debaixo d'água—em um momento inconveniente.

### Rival

Independente dos seus feitos, você sempre se compara com um antigo companheiro que sempre parecia estar um passo à sua frente.
**Benefício:** Escolha uma das suas perícias. Essa perícia recebe +3 de bônus para testes em vez de +2.
**Inconveniência:** Seu rival tem estatísticas similares às suas, mas ele sempre teve uma perícia na qual se destacava, determinada pelo Diretor. Intimidado por essa maestria, você recebe desvantagem em testes usando essa perícia.

### Romance Proibido

Você está apaixonado com uma pessoa poderosa, mas circunstâncias trágicas fazem com que não possam ficar juntos. Seja sua pessoa amada de uma família rival, prometida a outra pessoa, ou afastada de você, vocês estão destinados a ficarem separados.
**Benefício:** Você pode secretamente pedir favores para sua pessoa amada. Ainda que ela te apoie à distância, ela pode ter limites de quanto apoio consegue prover—e não pode revelar a conexão com você abertamente.
**Inconveniência:** Quando sua pessoa amada está em perigo, ela pode pedir a sua ajuda. Porém, se a sua relação for descoberta, as circunstâncias que os mantém separados se tornam piores.

### Rosto Roubado

Uma fada má amaldiçoou você o deixando com um semblante vazio em vez de um rosto. ainda que possa imitar os traços de outras pessoas, você gostaria de ter os seus de volta.

**Inconveniência:** Enquanto estiver morrendo, você cresce e retrai membros descoordenados aleatoriamente, impondo desvantagem em seus lançamentos de poder.

### Torre de Marfim

Você estudou em uma academia ou outra instituição educacional. Seu treinamento foi meticuloso e sua lista de leituras era variada. Porém, quando deixou a escola, você descobriu que haviam graves lacunas na sua educação. Talvez alguns daqueles livros eram obsoletos.
**Benefício:** Você tem três perícias à sua escolha, e conhece um idioma morto à sua escolha. (Veja Idiomas em Orden no Capítulo de Antecedentes).
**Inconveniência:** O Diretor escolhe uma das perícias que você tem por causa dessa complicação. Você perde essa perícia e não pode aprendê-la novamente. Além disso, você recebe desvantagem qualquer teste para o qual essa perícia se aplicaria.

### Verdejante

Você um dia sentiu o chamado de uma grande árvore no meio de uma floresta, que tinha sua vitalidade drenada por um musgo parasita sobrenatural preso a suas raízes. Conforme removia o musgo, você sentia que estava sendo preenchido por energia elemental verde. Infelizmente a árvore murchou antes que pudesse terminar o serviço, mas deixou um broto dourado que você carrega em busca de um lugar para plantá-lo.
**Benefício:** Você tem imunidade a corrupção 5.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a fogo 5.

### Vigarista

Você era um vigarista, mas deixou essa vida pra trás. Ser um herói é um esquema ainda melhor. Afinal, se você está salvando o mundo, quem vai se importar se roubar algumas moedas aqui ou ali?
**Benefício:** Você tem uma perícia à sua escolha do grupo de perícias de intriga.
**Inconveniência:** Sempre que você conhece um NPC pela primeira vez, o Diretor pode decidir que o NPC foi vítima de um dos seus esquemas anteriores e lembra de você. Nesse caso, o grupo ganha um Vale Heroico.

### Vínculo Vital

Em um ritual sinistro, sua alma foi ligada à de outra criatura. Pode ter sido um companheiro, uma pessoa para quem você deve ou um inimigo. Quando essa criatura morrer, você morre—fazendo de você o guarda-costas perfeito.
**Benefício:** Escolha outra criatura que não tem a complicação de Vínculo Vital. Quando você morre, seu corpo desaparece até essa criatura terminar um descanso ou conquistar 1 ou mais vitórias. Você então aparece ao lado dessa criatura, totalmente curado.
**Inconveniência:** Se a criatura a quem você está ligado morre, você morre também, independente de qualquer traços ou características que você tiver.

### Vítima de Culto

Cultistas capturaram você enquanto saqueavam sua casa e começaram um ritual profano para transformar seu corpo em um espírito morto-vivo. Ainda que o ritual tenha falhado, seu corpo ficou impregnado de magia de corrupção, deixando você parcialmente incorpóreo.
**Benefício:** Uma vez por turno, você pode se mover por até 1 quadrado de matéria sólida. Se terminar seu turno dentro da matéria sólida, você é forçado para fora no espaço pelo qual entrou e sofre 5 de dano que não pode ser reduzido de qualquer maneira.
**Inconveniência:** Você tem fraqueza a corrupção 5.

### Voz na Cabeça

Você ocasionalmente ouve uma voz na sua cabeça, dando ordens e oferecendo conselhos. Você não sabe a origem da voz ou por que escolheu você, porém quando seguiu seus conselhos, você geralmente não se arrependeu.
**Benefício:** O Diretor diz quando você ouve a voz. A voz parece ser consciente do seu entorno, e seus conselhos são geralmente vagos mas úteis. Em algum momento, as motivações dela podem ser diferentes das suas, mas por enquanto a voz parece estar dedicada a garantir que você sobreviva.
**Inconveniência:** Eventualmente, a voz revela querer algo de você que você não pode prover. Se a voz está insatisfeita com você, ela pode interromper você durante um descanso, fazendo com que restabeleça 2 recuperação a menos que o normal.

# **Testes**

hen you want your Herói to rifle through a desk and locate a
specific document, scale a castle Parede, negotiate a treaty with a
Monarca, or undertake qualquer other activity with a chance of
Falha, you’ll need to Fazer um Teste to determine how successful you are
at the task. A Teste is qualquer Poder roll that has Falha or consequences
as an option.

When to Fazer um Teste

The Diretor should ask a jogador to Fazer um Teste only when the jogador’s
Herói attempts a task where the consequences of Falha are interesting
or dramatic, and where Falha won’t grind the story to a halt. For
example, if a Herói wants to Pulo over a waist-high Parede while casually
walking through a peaceful city neighborhood, the worst case for
Falha is probably that the Herói falls on their butt, takes no dano,
and can Levantar to either try De Novo or Andar around the Parede. As such,
no Teste is required. But if the Herói were being chased by inimigos,
failing to Pulo over the Parede means the pursuers can catch them, so the
Diretor Músculo decide to call for a Teste to determine what happens.

The advancement of a story shouldn’t be halted by failing a Teste. For
instance, the heroes Músculo need to know the color of a Anão king’s
crown to solve a puzzle, with that puzzle opening the only entrance to
a tomb they must enter to stop a world-ending ritual. It could be that a
successful Razão Teste allows the heroes to Recolher that lore, but the Teste
shouldn’t be their only option to get the information. If the Teste fails,
perhaps the heroes need to go to a flying library to do research, or they
Músculo be able to delve into a ruin to find the ancient Monarca’s portrait.
A failed Teste should always result in a story becoming more interesting,
not in the action coming to an end.

**It Just Works!**

When a Herói attempts to solve a task that typically requires a Teste with
clever, outside-the-box thinking, the Diretor can instead decide that no
Teste is required and the attempt automatically works! For example, if a
Herói who wants to Escalar a Parede first covers their hands and feet in Gigante
strands of Grudento spider webs, the Diretor Músculo decide that they can
Escalar up the Parede without needing to Fazer um Teste.

That said, such clever ideas often work for free the first time, but the
Diretor could decide they require tests if they are used De Novo.

How to Fazer um Teste

Each Teste has the following steps:

The Diretor decides that a Herói’s activities call for a Teste and asks the
Herói’s jogador to make a Poder roll using an appropriate characteristic (see
Characteristics and Tests below). The Diretor then selects a difficulty for
the Poder roll, either secretly or publicly (see Dificuldade do Teste below).

The jogador makes the Poder roll. If the personagem has a Perícia that applies
to the Teste (see Skills later in this chapter), they can ask the Diretor if
the Perícia applies and justify the use of the Perícia. If the Diretor agrees the
Perícia applies, the Herói gains a +2 Bônus to the roll.

The jogador reports the total of the roll, and the Diretor interprets its
Sucesso or Falha.

```
Characteristics and Tests
When you describe a task you want your Herói to undertake and the
Diretor determines that a Teste is necessary, they then determine
which characteristic the Teste uses based on the Natureza of the task. For
instance, if you’re scaling a Parede, the Diretor could ask for a Músculo Teste
to determine how far and how quickly you’re able to Escalar. If you’re
attempting to plead your innocence in court for a murder you didn’t
commit, the Diretor Músculo ask for a Presença Teste if you’re attempting
to win over the jury with your personality, or a Razão Teste if you’re
laying out a logical Argumento to Suporte your innocence.
Though the Diretor can decide to call for tests in qualquer circumstances,
a number of tasks that heroes routinely undertake are commonly set
up as tests.
```

```
Músculo Tests
You make a Músculo Teste whenever a risky task calls for the use of
physical strength. Músculo tests are most often used for breaking down
doors and other structures, Arremesável heavy objetos, pulling your body
up a sheer Parede, Nadador against a mighty current, and other feats of
physical Poder.
```

```
Agilidade Tests
You make an Agilidade Teste whenever a risky task calls for the use of your
physical coordination and nimbleness. Agilidade tests are most often
used for tumbling, sneaking quietly, picking locks, and engaging in
sleight of hand.
```

```
Razão Tests
You make a Razão Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your mental acumen and education, formal or
otherwise. Razão tests are most often used to Recolher lore, deduce
information based on clues, complete a puzzle, forge counterfeit items
or documents, break a code, convince others of a logical Argumento, or
make an estimation.
```

```
Intuição Tests
You make an Intuição Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your powers of observation and instinct. Intuição
tests are most often used to notice Escondida criaturas or details, discern
another person’s motivations or honesty, Calmaria and reassure others, and
train animals.
```

```
Presença Tests
You make a Presença Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your force of personality. Presença tests are most
often used to gain trust, project confidence, and influence and Liderar
other criaturas.hough it’s easier than easy, then
```

**Dificuldade do Teste**

```
The Diretor decides how difficult a task that requires a Teste is: easy,
Médium, or hard. If a task seems as though it’s easier than easy, then
no Teste is necessary. The Herói simply accomplishes the task. If the task
seems harder than hard, then the Diretor is free to decide that it’s
impossible to complete with a Teste.
On a Teste-by-Teste basis, the Diretor can share the difficulty of a task
before the jogador makes the Teste, which makes interpreting the
outcome faster at the table. The Diretor can also keep a Teste’s difficulty
secret until after the jogador rolls the Teste, for dramatic Efeito.
```

```
The Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table shows all the possible outcomes of
the different difficulties of tests. The Diretor will keep this information
Habilidoso so as to be able to compare the different difficulties and their
outcomes during play.
```

```
Whenever the rules talk about obtaining a Sucesso on a Teste, that
includes a straight Sucesso, a Sucesso com Consequência, or a Sucesso
with a Recompensa. Whenever the rules talk about a Falha on a Teste, that
includes a straight Falha or a Falha com Consequência.
Whenever you Fazer um Teste whose outcome you don’t like, you can
Gastar a Herói token to reroll the Teste. You must use the new roll.
```

```
Easy Tests
An Teste Fácil has some risk of consequence, but most heroes will likely
overcome it. The Poder roll you make for an Teste Fácil determines the
outcome (see Teste Outcomes below):
```

```
á You succeed on the task and incur a consequence.
é You succeed on the task.
í You succeed on the task with a Recompensa.
```

```
Médium Tests
A Médium Teste has some risk of Falha that most heroes will likely
overcome—but with a cost. The Poder roll you make for a Médium Teste
determines the outcome:
```

```
á You fail the task.
é You succeed on the task and incur a consequence.
í You succeed on the task.
```

```
Hard Tests
A Teste Difícil has a greater risk of Falha, and most heroes are likely to
suffer some hardship while trying to overcome the intended task. The
Poder roll you make for a Teste Difícil determines the outcome:
```

```
á You fail the task and incur a consequence.
é You fail the task.
í You succeed on the task.
```

```
Natural 19 or 20: Sucesso With a Recompensa
Whenever you get a natural 19 or 20 on the Poder roll for a Teste—a total
of 19 or 20 before adding your characteristic score or other modifiers—
you score a critical Sucesso. This critical Sucesso automatically lets you
succeed on the task with a Recompensa, even if the Teste has a Médium or
hard difficulty.
```

**Teste Outcomes**

```
Depending on a Teste’s difficulty and the Poder roll made to
accomplish the task represented by the Teste, you can obtain um of the
following outcomes.
```

```
Falha com Consequência
If you fail a Teste Difícil and incur a consequence, you don’t do what you
set out to do—in addition to which, you suffer an impactful setback.
The Diretor determines the exact Natureza of the consequence, which is
typically related to the specific task.
For instance, if a Herói suffers a consequence while trying to Escalar a
Parede, they Músculo make it halfway up the Parede and then fall, taking
dano and landing Derrubado. A Herói trying to Furtivo by cultists Músculo
be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence
strikes when a Herói attempts to bribe a prison Guarda, the Guarda Músculo
decide to Prisão the Herói or Liderar them into a Armadilha. If a Herói suffers a
consequence on a Razão Teste made to Recolher lore about the king’s
favorite meal, they Músculo confuse it for a dish to which the Monarca is
deathly allergic.
```

```
Not all consequences need to be immediate or apparent. For example,
a Herói Músculo fail with a consequence on a Teste made to cheat at a
high-stakes game of cards with a Nobre. The Falha means the cheating
is noticed, but the Diretor decides that the Nobre doesn’t say anything.
This consequence isn’t made apparent until later in the evening, when
the Nobre has guards surround the Herói, intent on taking the cheater
down to the dungeon for stacking the deck.
```

```
Influencing jogador Characters With Tests
```

```
The things jogador characters do can’t be influenced by qualquer
criatura making a Teste, whether a Monstro, an NPC, or another
jogador personagem. Many jogadores feel that their agency is taken
away if they’re compelled to Pular into a pile of gold filled
with Escondida scorpions because an NPC convinced them to do
so with a Presença Teste. For most jogadores, it’s not fun to be in
control of a Herói and lose some of that control.
```

```
Instead, Directors should do their Nível best to have an NPC
suggest that a personagem Mergulho headlong into the gold like a
billionaire duck, then let the jogador decide what their personagem
does. Similarly, a Diretor Músculo decide that um jogador
personagem can’t make an Intuição Teste to discern another PC’s
motivations or honesty.
That said, if everyone in your gaming group decides to Levantar um
or more of these restrictions after talking about it, go for it!
There’s no wrong way to play as long as everyone is having
fun. The MCDM Safety Toolkit (available for download at
https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit ) discusses how to talk about
potentially problematic topics such as limiting personagem agency
at your table.

Tests
```

Common consequences for failing a Teste include the following:

¥ Making an NPC so upset that they Tempestade off, or betray, attack, or
otherwise attempt to harm you
¥ Drawing the attention of a group of foes
¥ Triggering a Armadilha or Perigo that captures or significantly harms
you or an aliado
¥ Breaking an important piece of Equipamento that is difficult to
replace or repair
¥ Thinking you know something that you don’t
¥ Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved with a Negociação
or a Teste de Montagem you didn’t need to make before

In lieu of other consequences, the Diretor also has the option to gain 2
additional Malícia—a resource that criaturas run by the Diretor use in
Combate—no começo of the next Combate Encontro.

Falha
If you fail a Teste without incurring a consequence, you simply don’t
do what you set out to do. A Herói attempting to Escalar a Parede finds no
purchase. A Herói trying to Recolher lore can’t remember the desired facts.
If a Herói attempts to bribe a Guarda, they don’t take the bait.

On a failed Teste, the Diretor can decide that there Músculo still be a small
Penalidade for Falha, depending on the circumstances of the Teste. This
Penalidade shouldn’t be as harsh as rolling a Falha com Consequência,
though. For instance, a Herói who gets this outcome on an Agilidade Teste
made to Furtivo by a group of cultists Músculo draw the attention of um
cultist with their Falha. Now that cultist is coming to investigate, but
they haven’t raised the alarm ... yet.

When a Herói rolls a Falha without a consequence, the Diretor can
offer to let them succeed with a consequence instead. For instance,
when a Herói rolls a 10 on a Médium Músculo Teste to break down a locked
door, that’s a Falha and the door stays closed. But the Diretor could
suggest to the jogador that instead of not breaking down the door, they
can break down the door and lose 1d6 Vigor from being injured
in the effort.

Sucesso com Consequência
If you succeed on a Teste and incur a consequence, you do what you set
out to do, but with an added cost. A Herói Músculo succeed in Escalador
up a Parede, but the surface of the Parede crumbles and becomes unstable
as they do, making the Escalar more difficult for the aliado ascending after
them. When trying to Furtivo by a cultist, a Herói successfully does so,
but leaves footprints or other evidence of trespassing behind. If a Herói
bribes a Guarda to be allowed to Furtivo into a prison, the Guarda lets them
in—but then demands a gemstone the Herói needs for an important
Projeto de Criação before they let the Herói out.

Just like Falha com Consequência, the consequences accompanying
Sucesso don’t need to be immediately apparent. In lieu of other conse-
quences, the Diretor has the option to gain 2 additional Malícia at the
start of the next Combate Encontro.

When a Herói rolls a Sucesso com Consequência, the Diretor Músculo
give them a chance to fail instead. For instance, when a Herói rolls a 10
on an easy Agilidade Teste to pick the lock on a chest, that’s a Sucesso with a
consequence. The Diretor could suggest that the personagem has opened
the lock but broken their lockpicks in the process (knowing the picks
can’t be replaced until the Herói returns to town), but can also give them
the option of failing to pick the lock but keeping their lockpicks intact.

```
Sucesso
If you succeed on a Teste without consequence or Recompensa, you simply
achieve whatever you set out to do. A Herói climbs that Parede, sneaks by
those cultists, or bribes that Guarda just as they planned. Smooth.
```

```
Sucesso With a Recompensa
If you succeed on a Teste with a Recompensa, you accomplish whatever you
set out to do. But you also gain a little something extra, in the form of
momentum or luck that makes the immediate future easier for you or
your friends.
The Diretor determines the Recompensa for a Sucesso, which is most often
related to the task at hand. For instance, if a Herói succeeds with a
Recompensa while Escalador a Parede, they Músculo find a ladder at the top they
can lower so that qualquer aliados Escalador up after them can do so without
needing to Fazer um Teste. A Herói trying to Furtivo by cultists who succeeds
with a Recompensa Músculo be able to dose the cultists’ nearby Água barrel
with sleeping Veneno as they pass by unseen. Succeeding with a Recompensa
while bribing a prison Guarda could mean that the Guarda unlocks a door
for the Herói in addition to forgetting they were ever there.
```

```
As with consequences, the Recompensa that comes with a Sucesso doesn’t
need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a Herói succeeds with
a Recompensa on an Teste Fácil made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards
with a Nobre. Not only does the Herói win the game, but the Diretor
decides that their Recompensa comes from a servant watching the game
who’s impressed with the personagem’s Atuar. After the game, the
servant approaches the Herói, offering Magia from the Nobre’s private
stash in congratulations and admiration.
Common rewards accompanying Sucesso on a Teste include
the following:
```

```
¥ Automatically accomplishing a related follow-up task that would
typically require a Teste
¥ Allowing an aliado engaged in the same task to accomplish the task
without needing to make the Teste as well
¥ Obtaining a Consumível Tesouro or useful piece of
Mundano Equipamento
¥ Learning a piece of helpful information
¥ Impressing or ingratiating yourself with someone who grants you
a small favor
¥ Noticing a Escondida danger well before it strikes, giving you time to
avoid or prepare for it
In lieu of other rewards, the Diretor can also decide that a Herói who
succeeds on a Teste with a Recompensa earns the jogadores a Herói token (see
Herói Tokens in Chapter 1: The Basics).
```

```
Regra Opcional: Pitching Consequences and Rewards
Coming up with consequences and rewards for tests can be
a big part of the fun for many Directors, but even the best
Directors occasionally run low on ideas. That’s why the
game gives the default option of consequences and rewards
in the form of Malícia and Herói tokens. However, a Diretor
who prefers narrative consequences and rewards can ask the
jogadores to pitch different consequences and rewards when
they Fazer um Teste. The Diretor can reject, add to, or modify the
jogadores’ ideas as they choose, and will remind the jogadores that
they need to pitch real consequences, and not minor rewards
disguised as consequences.
```

Draw Steel

```
How Long Does It Take?
The amount of time required for a task involving a Teste is determined
by the Diretor. A task such as recalling lore with a Razão Teste Músculo
take no time at all. Ducking behind a barrel to Esconder-se with an Agilidade
Teste Músculo require a Manobra or a Ação Principal, while tracking a
band of voiceless talkers through the World Below could take hours
or even days.
```

```
Tests During Combate
Many (but not all) tests that a Herói Músculo make during Combate are
made as maneuvers. See Maneuvers in Chapter 10: Combate for more
information.
```

**Can I Try De Novo?**

```
In many cases when you fail a Teste, you can’t attempt the Teste De Novo
unless the circumstances of the Teste change. For instance, if you attempt
an Agilidade Teste to pick a lock and fail, you can’t attempt to pick the
lock De Novo unless you get better lockpicks, oil the lock, have someone
demonstrate how to pick a similar lock, and so on.
The Diretor decides when the circumstances have changed enough to
allow a new attempt at a Teste.
```

Heroes Make Tests

```
If a Herói attempts to Furtivo by an inimigo Guarda unnoticed, should
the Herói make an Agilidade Teste to Furtivo, or should the Guarda make an
Intuição Teste to catch the Herói in the act? If a cultist lies to a Herói about
the location of a secret temple, does the cultist roll a Presença Teste to
conceal the truth, or does the Herói roll an Intuição Teste to discern the
cultist’s honesty?
```

```
Except in certain scenarios (explored at NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks
and Opposed Poder Rolls below), heroes make tests and NPCs do not.
Heroes are the stars of the story, and the consequences and rewards of
tests have longer-lasting implications for them. There are exceptions to
this rule, of course. If a Herói travels with an NPC Militante or companion,
that NPC will almost certainly make tests from time to time. But for the
most part, NPCs and other criaturas never need to make tests when
what they do opposes what the heroes do.
```

```
To quickly assess the difficulty of a task opposed by um or more
criaturas and the Teste made to attempt it, the Diretor can use the
following guidelines (though these are not hard and fast rules):
Teste Fácil: A Teste is easy if only um criatura opposes the Herói, and that
opposed criatura would have a lower Bônus to their Teste roll for the
task than the Herói does. If a Herói with an Agilidade score of 2 attempts
to Furtivo by a Guarda with an Intuição score of 0, the Teste is easy.
Teste Médio: A Teste is moderate if multiple criaturas oppose the Herói
and those criaturas would have lower bonuses to their Teste rolls than
the Herói, or if only um criatura opposes the Herói and has the same
Teste Bônus as the Herói.
Teste Difícil: A Teste is hard if an opposed criatura would have a higher
Bônus to their Teste roll than the Herói, or if multiple criaturas with the
same Teste Bônus as the Herói oppose the Herói.
```

```
The Falha consequences of opposed tasks are some of the easiest to
create on the Voar. Fail to Esconder-se from someone, and they notice you. Fail
to Mentir to someone, and they catch your duplicity. Fail to arm wrestle
someone for a free ale, and you’re picking up the tab. The consequence
is that the opposition bests the Herói.
```

```
Tests
```

**NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks**

At times, the Diretor Músculo choose for an NPC to Fazer um Teste when
engaged in a deceptive task, rather than having characters attempt
to note the deception. By having the NPC roll in these scenarios, the
Diretor doesn’t tip their hand to the jogadores that Subterfúgio is afoot.

For example, when an Assassino attempts to ambush the heroes while
they sit around a campfire, if qualquer jogador says their Herói is on the
Vigia for danger, that Herói would make an Intuição Teste to notice the
danger. But if no um is keeping watch, the Assassino makes an Agilidade
Teste to Furtivo up on the heroes unnoticed. If the Assassino fails the Teste,
the heroes notice immediately as their assailant loudly steps on a twig.
If the Assassino succeeds, the heroes don’t notice until the assailant is
right on top of them.

An NPC Músculo also make a Presença Teste if they Mentir to the heroes, as
long as the heroes have no Razão to believe the personagem would be
deceptive. The Diretor knows if the heroes are wary in that way
because the jogadores will ask if they can Fazer um Teste to discern the
NPC’s honesty.

As an Regra Opcional, the Diretor is also free to ask the heroes to make
a Teste Reativo to a deceptive NPC instead (see Reativa Tests below)
whenever they choose.

**Opposed Poder Rolls**

When dois criaturas are engaged in a particularly dramatic struggle
that requires them both to make tests, the Diretor can have all the
criaturas involved Fazer um Teste. The criatura with the highest Poder roll
wins. You can’t earn a Recompensa as part of these opposed Poder rolls, and
they don’t follow the typical difficulty structure or have três different
tiers of possible outcomes.

For example, if your Herói attempts to Furtivo by a Demônio lord, you make
an Agilidade Teste to Mover stealthily while the Demônio makes an Intuição
Teste to notice you. If your Herói gets the higher Poder roll, you Furtivo
by without the Demônio noticing. If the Demônio gets the higher roll, they
catch you in the act of sneaking. If multiple sneaking heroes attempt
to get by multiple demons, then each criatura makes a Teste and all the
totals are compared to determine which demons notice which heroes.

In the event of a tie in an opposed Teste, the state of the scene doesn’t
change. In the previous example, a tie means that if a Demônio on Guarda
duty didn’t know a sneaking Herói was there, the Demônio remains
oblivious. If the Demônio did know the Herói was out there somewhere
while trying to avoid being noticed, a tie means the Demônio still knows
the Herói is there but hasn’t determined their location.

Since opposed Poder rolls don’t use tiers, when you make an opposed
Poder roll, a double Vantagem provides a +4 Bônus to the roll, a double Desvantagem
provides a -4 Penalidade to the roll, an automatic Grau increase counts as
a +4 Bônus to the roll, and an automatic Grau decrease counts as a -4
Penalidade to the roll.

Reativa Tests

At certain times when a Herói isn’t engaged in overcoming a task,
the Diretor Músculo ask the jogador of the Herói to Fazer um Teste without
context, explaining the Teste only after the Poder roll is made. This often
happens when a Herói has a chance of knowing or noticing something
of significance that the jogador doesn’t know to look for or ask about.

Reativa tests are typically made in the following circumstances,
though the Diretor can call for them in qualquer appropriate scenario:

```
Escondida Environmental Features: The Diretor asks for an Intuição
Teste to notice a secret door, a Escondida Armadilha, or some other disguised
environmental Recurso.
Escondida Foes: The Diretor calls for an Intuição Teste to
notice a Escondida foe (or they could use the rules in
NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks above).
Escondida Motives: The Diretor can ask for an Intuição Teste during a
conversation to gauge how well a Herói can read an NPC, judging
whether they’re lying, withholding information, or concealing
an emotional response. (The Diretor could also use the rules in
NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks.)
Recolher Lore: The Diretor Músculo ask a Herói to make a Razão Teste
when dealing with a new objeto, a piece of information, or an
event to determine what História or details the Herói Músculo already
know about it.
criatura and DTO Tests: Some criaturas and dynamic terrain objetos in
Draw Steel: Monstros have features and abilities that require heroes
to make Reativa tests. These tests can’t be modified by skills.
```

```
Regra Opcional: Secret Reativa Tests
Some Directors prefer to make the Poder rolls for Reativa
tests for the heroes rather than asking the jogadores to do so.
This allows the Diretor to make the rolls when appropriate
for Escondida objetos, criaturas, motivations, and information
without tipping off the jogadores that there is information to
be gained. Having the Diretor roll requires the Diretor to
have everyone’s characteristics and skills recorded (whether
physically or digitally) for easy reference.
```

Draw Steel

```
Skills
Skills represent the different specializations a Herói has outside of
attacking, defending, and using their Linhagem features, Classe features,
and Equipamento. Whenever you Fazer um Teste, having a particular Perícia
associated with the Teste increases your chance of Sucesso.
```

**Applying Skills**

```
If you have a Perícia that applies to a Teste you make, you gain a +2 Bônus
to the Teste. For instance, if your Herói has the Esconder-se Perícia, you have a +2
Bônus to qualquer Teste you make that involves hiding yourself. This Músculo
include an Agilidade Teste to Esconder-se behind a barrel, or a Presença Teste to
disappear into a crowd.
The +2 Bônus gained for a Perícia isn’t an Vantagem. A jogador can Fazer um Teste
that has both the +2 Bônus for a Perícia and the +2 Bônus for an Vantagem.
```

```
You can’t apply more than um Perícia to a Teste.
```

```
Justify the Perícia
It’s not the Diretor’s job to know every task potentially covered by the
skills in the game, or to know the specific skills your Herói has. Instead,
the Diretor asks you to Fazer um Teste using a characteristic and you tell
the Diretor if you think you have a Perícia that applies. If it’s not obvious
why the Perícia applies, tell the Diretor how your Herói is approaching
the task and justify why that approach uses the Perícia. The Diretor
then decides if you get the +2 Bônus the Perícia represents. If the Diretor
disagrees with you, that’s the final word.
Approaching problems creatively while remaining reasonable can
help you get the most out of your skills. For example, if you’re making
a Presença Teste to impress a Nobre at a party, using the Gabar-se Perícia is an
obvious choice. But what if you don’t have that Perícia? Maybe you could
instead try to impress the Nobre with a brief but exciting lecture about
the Natureza of the elements, making a Presença Teste using the Magia Perícia
that you do have!
```

```
Sometimes you won’t have a Perícia that applies to a Teste. That’s okay!
If your characteristic score is decent, you likely have a good chance of
Sucesso without a Perícia.
```

```
Mixing Characteristics and Skills
Although certain skills are often paired with um characteristic more
than others, a Perícia can apply to a Teste made using qualquer characteristic that
makes sense. The Diretor has the final say on which characteristic is
used to complete a task, and can call for a different characteristic based
on the circumstances.
For example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal threat is a
Presença Teste. But if a jogador describes their personagem tearing a log in
half with their bare hands to Intimidar a foe, the Diretor is likely to
call for a Músculo Teste instead. The Intimidar Perícia can apply to both tests.
In the same way, scaling the side of a building is covered by a Músculo
Teste, but if a Herói does a series of leaps from um balcony to another to
Alcance a roof, the Diretor could call for an Agilidade Teste instead. The Escalar
Perícia applies to both of these tests.
```

**Many Specific Skills**

```
Draw Steel includes a big list of skills, and each is fairly specific. For
example, instead of um Athletics Perícia that covers Escalador, jumping,
Nadador, and lifting heavy objetos, your personagem Músculo use separate
Escalar, Pular, Levantar, and Nadar skills. Instead of a Thievery Perícia that covers
picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps, the game has três
skills: Arrombar Fechadura, Furtar, and Sabotar.
```

```
Having a wide Alcance of specific skills means you’ll frequently make
tests that don’t use um of your personagem’s skills, simply applying a
characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it means that having
a personagem who covers the spread of every Perícia is actually impossible.
Luckily, the math of the game doesn’t require you to have a Perícia to have
a decent chance of Sucesso on a Teste. That means heroes can attempt
tasks without the help of a Perícia just because someone needs to do it,
and that’s pretty darn heroic!
```

```
Since you don’t need to worry about your personagem covering a wide
spread of skills, you’re free to choose the skills you think fit your Herói
best and are the most fun to work with. Maybe you’re thinking about
an Elementalista who has a gymnastic Antecedentes in jumping and
tumbling, and who also studied Religião and Forja. Having
that kind of specific backstory is a big part of cinematic storytelling.
The rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly applied to qualquer Teste that
is appropriate for the Perícia. This encourages clever thinking. A jogador can
ask the Diretor, “I want to impress the duke with a story about how
I ascended the sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Escalar Perícia for a
+2 Bônus to my Presença Teste?” Getting Criativa like that is a lot of fun.
It paints a visual picture, and it’s good tactical thinking! However, if the
skills in a game are too broad in the kinds of activities they represent,
jogadores inevitably end up applying the same Perícia over and over De Novo to
as many tests as possible. This isn’t fun for anyone, and doesn’t make a
very compelling story.
```

```
Edges on Tests With Specific Skills
```

```
Certain features and abilities grant a criatura an Vantagem on tests
made with a specific Perícia. A criatura making a Teste where the
specific Perícia would apply gains an Vantagem on the Teste even if
they don’t have the Perícia. For example, the Conduíta’s Blessing
of Fortunate Weather can create Tempo Enevoado weather that grants
criaturas who make tests using the Esconder-se Perícia an Vantagem on those
tests. qualquer criatura who attempts to Esconder-se in the Névoa gains an
Vantagem on the Teste as long as the Esconder-se Perícia would apply to that
Teste, regardless of whether they have that Perícia or not.
```

```
Are All Skills Equal?
When choosing skills for your personagem, deciding which
skills will be most useful depends a lot on the campaign. For
instance, the Nadar Perícia Músculo be used constantly during
a campaign that takes place on the ocean and has heroes
exploring underwater ruins, but it won’t come up as much in a
campaign that takes place entirely in a vast desert. The Psiônica
Perícia Músculo come up a lot in a campaign where voiceless talkers
are the main foes, and Magia Músculo be more useful in a game
where the heroes take on a circle of evil wizards. If you’re
worried about whether a Perícia you’d like to take will be useful,
discuss your Perícia list with the Diretor after you create a Herói.
And if a Perícia doesn’t work out, you can always Comércio de Almas it for
another Perícia as you wish (see Changing personagem Options in
Chapter 2: Making a Herói).
```

```
Tests
```

**Perícia Groups**

Skills are broken down into five Perícia groups: crafting, exploration, inter-
personal, intrigue, and lore.

Perícias de Criação
Skills from the crafting Perícia group are used in the Criação and appraisal
of goods and for jury-rigging contraptions. They are especially useful
during rests and downtime.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Criação typically include having
leftover rare material used in the Criação process, knowing a buyer
willing to pay extra for goods or items you’re appraising, or making a
jury-rigged device so amazing that it lasts for more uses than it should.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Criação typically include
wasting rare materials used in the Criação process, greatly overesti-
mating or underestimating an item’s value, and poorly jury-rigging a
contraption so that it harms people (or at least the wrong people).

```
Perícias de Criação
Perícia Use
Alquimia Make bombs and potions
Arquitetura Create buildings and vehicles
Forja Forge metal armor and weapons
Carpintaria Create items out of wood
Culinária Create delicious dishes
Flecharia Make À Distância weapons and ammunition
Falsificação Create false badges, documents, and other items
Joalheiria Create bracelets, crowns, rings, and other Joalheiria
Mecânica Build machines and clockwork items
Alfaiataria Craft clothing of cloth or leather
```

```
Perícias de Exploração

Curar Use Mundano first aid
Pular Pulo Vertical and horizontal distances
Levantar Pick up, carry, and Jogar heavy objetos
Navegação Read a map and travel without becoming lost
Montar Montar and control a nonsapient Montaria, such as a cavalo
Nadar Mover through deep liquid
```

Perícias de Exploração
Skills from the exploration Perícia group are used to physically explore the
Ambiente around the characters, and to overcome physical obstacles.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Exploração typically include helping
another criatura engaging in the same task succeed without needing
to also Fazer um Teste, automatically succeeding on a follow-up Teste while
engaged in the same task, reaching a destination faster than anticipated,
and learning about or avoiding an upcoming Perigo.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Exploração include harming
yourself, your Equipamento, or your aliados; becoming lost; or stumbling headlong
into a Perigo or a place you were trying to avoid.

Perícias Interpessoais
Skills from the interpersonal Perícia group are used to socially interact
with other criaturas, and are particularly useful during negotiations
(see Chapter 11). Aside from the Trato Animal Perícia, you can
generally only use Perícias Interpessoais when you attempt to influence
criaturas who have emotions and who can understand you.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias Interpessoais typically include
gaining an extra favor, item, or piece of information from the people or
criaturas you interact with.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias Interpessoais include making
the criatura you’re interacting with angry, sad, embarrassed, offended,
or otherwise upset or uncomfortable. This Músculo cause them to ignore
you, Tempestade off, spread Boatos about you, attack you, betray you,
blackmail you, or otherwise attempt to harm you.

```
Perícias Interpessoais
Perícia Use
Gabar-se Impress others with stories of your deeds
Empatizar Relate to someone on a personal Nível

```

```
Perform Engage in dance, oratory, acting, or some other physical Atuar
```

```
Persuadir Convince someone to agree with you through use of your charms and grace
```

```
Ler Pessoas Read the emotions and body idioma of other criaturas
```

Draw Steel

```
Perícias de Conhecimento
Skills from the lore Perícia group are used to research and Recolher specific
information. They are especially useful during rests and downtime.
```

```
Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Conhecimento typically include learning an
extra piece of useful information.
Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Conhecimento typically include learning
an incorrect piece of information that seems useful, but which actually
works against your interests or wastes time. (It’s fun to roleplay these
kinds of moments, so lean in!) Alternatively, the Diretor can make
Médium and hard tests with lore group skills for each Herói in secret,
then let the jogadores know the narrative outcome without revealing the
outcome of the Poder roll (see the Regra Opcional: Secret Reativa Tests
sidebar earlier in this chapter).
```

```
Perícias de Intriga
Perícia Use
Atenção Intuitively sense the details of your surroundings
Conceal objeto Esconder-se an objeto on your person or in your Ambiente
Disfarce Change your appearance to look like a different person

```

```
Escapar Escape from bonds such as rope or manacles

```

```
Estratégia Knowing about battle tactics and logistics
Timescape Knowing about the many worlds of the timescape
```

```
Perícias de Intriga
Skills from the intrigue Perícia group are used in tasks centered around
investigation, thievery, and spycraft.
Rewards for tests made with skills from this group typically include
helping another criatura engaging in the same task succeed without
needing to also Fazer um Teste, automatically succeeding on a follow-up
Teste while engaged in the same task, discovering helpful information
in addition to what you set out to learn, and performing an extra bit of
clandestine activity in addition to what you set out to do.
```

```
Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Intriga include getting caught
in the act or failing to notice a detail that places you in danger, such as
triggering a Armadilha or walking into an ambush.
```

```
For the Diretor: Make Your Own Skills
Directors should feel free to make their own skills that they
feel are relevant and useful to their campaigns and adventures.
For instance, the game doesn’t have a Brewing Perícia for brewing
ale or a Painting Perícia for making art because those aren’t tasks
that typically come up in a game about fighting Monstros and
saving the world. However, a Diretor could decide that their
campaign involves poisoned barrels of ale and large amounts
of counterfeit art, and that adding these dois new skills to the
game would make it more fun for the jogadores. The Diretor
simply needs to pick a group for these new skills—in this case,
crafting makes sense. They then let the jogadores know that they
can swap out qualquer crafting Perícia they have for these new skills.
```

```
Tests
```

Example Tests

In this scenario, a trio of adventurers want to scale the 40-foot-high
walls surrounding a castle known as the Star Chamber, hoping to
covertly obtain information about their inimigo, Lady Morgant.

**Diretor (Matt):** _The towering walls that surround the Star Chamber
stand before you, the single Ferro gate closed and locked, with a Pelotão of
armed guards outside._

**James (playing Korvo, a Sombra):** _Let’s Mover to the side of the Parede
opposite the gate and make our ascent there._

**Grace (playing Val, a Conduíta):** _Agreed._

**Diretor:** _Okay. It’ll be a Músculo Teste to get up to the top of the Parede._

The Diretor knows that the walls around the Star Chamber, the head-
quarters of the evil knights Lady Morgant leads, are smooth and hard
to Escalar, designed to Repelir invaders. The Teste’s difficulty is hard, but the
Diretor keeps that information a secret for now.

**Alyssa (playing Jorn, a Tático):** _Let me go first. I’ve got good Músculo and can
Jogar the others down a rope once I’m up there. And I’ve got the Escalar Perícia._

**Diretor:** _For sure. Okay, roll it up._

Alyssa rolls 2d10 and gets a 13. She then adds her Músculo score of 2 and
her +2 Bônus for having an applicable Perícia to the roll, for a total of 17.

**Alyssa:** _A 17! That’s Grau 3, baby!_

The Diretor checks the Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table to confirm that
a Grau 3 outcome is a Sucesso on a Teste Difícil.

**Diretor:** _Okay, you’re on top of the Parede. You notice a few guards
patrolling atop the opposite side of the Parede in the Distância, but they’re
looking out at the city right now._

**Alyssa:** _Great! I Lançamento down a rope. Val, you’re next._

**Grace:** _So it’s a Músculo Teste. Would you let me use Resiliência? It’s a lot of
physical exertion to Escalar._

**Diretor:** _It’s not a Escalar that would take you hours, so I don’t think
Resiliência applies here. But hey, the rope does make this an easier Teste._

**Grace:** _Fair. Okay, dice. Let’s do this._

Given the rope, the Diretor decides that this second Escalar attempt is
an Teste Fácil. Grace rolls 2d10 and gets an 11. With her Músculo score of 2,
that’s a 13.

**Grace:** _13! That’s a Grau 2 outcome for Val._

The Diretor checks the Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table once more,
confirming that a Grau 2 outcome is a Sucesso on an Teste Fácil.

**Diretor:** _Good news! You make it to the top of the Parede alongside Jorn._

**James:** _Ah, crap. I have a Músculo of −1 and no skills to use. Unless I can
Intimidar the rope into lifting me up?_

**Diretor:** _Wishful thinking._

**Alyssa:** _What if Korvo grabs onto the rope and I Levantar him up while he just
hangs on for the Montar?_

**Diretor:** _Sure. That’ll be a Músculo Teste if Korvo’s down for it._

**James:** _Nothing risked, nothing saved. Let’s do it. Just be careful. qualquer loud
noises could attract those guards._

```
Alyssa: Please. I’m a pro. Since I’m lifting this polder off the Chão, does
the Levantar Perícia apply?
```

```
Diretor: Yes, it does. Roll it up. That’s a Médium difficulty Teste.
Lifting the diminutive polder, Alyssa rolls 2d10—but gets a 2! With her
Músculo score and Levantar Perícia Bônus of +2, the total is 6.
```

```
Alyssa: A 6! Oof. That’s Grau 1.
Diretor: Which is a Falha, but with no consequence. You realize you
just can’t Levantar Korvo off the Chão without making a lot of noise.
```

```
The Diretor then decides to make the Falha potentially more
interesting, by allowing the jogadores to decide if they want a Falha
without consequence or a Sucesso com Consequência.
Diretor: I’ll give you a choice, though. You can leave Korvo on the
Chão, or Puxar him up and suffer the consequence of making some noise
while doing so.
```

```
Grace: Ah, Puxar the polder up.
Alyssa: Yeah. We have to face these guards sometime.
```

```
James: Thanks for not leaving me behind!
Diretor: As Jorn yanks Korvo off the Chão and pulls him up to the top
of the Parede, a Guarda turns a bullseye lantern your way, calling out, “Who
goes there?”
```

Draw Steel

```
Auxiliar um Teste
You can attempt to assist another criatura with a Teste they make,
provided you have a Perícia that applies to the Teste, the other criatura
isn’t using that same Perícia on the Teste, and you can describe how your
personagem helps to the Diretor’s satisfaction. In other words, your
attempt to help has to make sense, and you have to bring some useful
expertise to the table. Helping another criatura Furtivo by shouting
encouragement at them isn’t going to make them stealthier.
```

```
When you attempt to assist another criatura, Fazer um Teste using the Perícia
you choose, and using a characteristic chosen by the Diretor based on
the activity you use to help. The outcome of that Teste determines the
Bônus applied to the Teste you’re assisting:
```

```
á You get in the way or make things worse. The criatura takes a
Desvantagem on their Teste.
é Your help grants the other criatura an Vantagem on their Teste.
í Your help gives the other criatura a double Vantagem on their Teste.
For example, when an aliado tries to pick a jailer’s pocket, you Músculo
attempt to assist by using the Flertar Perícia to distract the jailer. The
Diretor accepts this, and asks you to make a Presença Teste using Flertar.
The outcome of that Teste determines the Bônus you provide to the
other Herói’s Agilidade Teste to pick the jailer’s pocket—or whether you
fumble the distraction and potentially draw attention to the attempt.
```

Esconder-se and Furtivo

```
Hiding and sneaking are important tools for heroes and their foes. You
Músculo want to avoid another criatura’s notice to Bisbilhotar on conver-
sations, steal items, set up an ambush, or avoid a Combate Encontro.
```

```
Hiding
To Esconder-se from a criatura, you must have Cobertura or Encobrimento from that
criatura (see Chapter 10: Combate), who can’t observe you attempting
to Esconder-se. A criatura is observing you if they’re aware of your specific
location before you attempt to Esconder-se. This means they can pinpoint you
with their senses and point a finger (or paw or Tentáculo) at you as if to
shout, “There they are!” If you duck behind a barrel to Esconder-se from a foe,
your attempt to Esconder-se has a chance of succeeding only if your foe doesn’t
notice you doing so. If you’re being chased by a hungry Dragão, you can
Esconder-se only if you first Mover to a location where the Dragão can’t observe
you—for instance, by turning a sharp corner into a tunnel full of Gigante
stalagmites before the Dragão does. You then make your Esconder-se attempt.
```

```
When you use the Esconder-se Manobra to Esconder-se during Combate while you
have Cobertura or Encobrimento from a criatura who isn’t observing you,
you are automatically Escondida from them unless the Diretor deems
otherwise. If you Esconder-se fora de Combate, the Diretor Músculo ask you to
Fazer um Teste using the Esconder-se Perícia to determine how well Escondida you are.
While you are Escondida from another criatura, the criatura can’t alvo
you with abilities that don’t have the Área Palavra-Chave. This Benefício ends
as soon as you are no longer Escondida from that criatura.
```

```
Additionally, while you are Escondida from another criatura, you gain an
Vantagem on Habilidade rolls made against that criatura. This Benefício lasts until
the end of the Turno in which you are no longer Escondida. This means you
can be Escondida from another criatura no começo of your Turno, Mover out
of Cobertura or Encobrimento toward them and use an Habilidade against them,
and still gain an Vantagem on Habilidade rolls made against the criatura as long
as you use the Habilidade before the end of that Turno.
```

```
Tests
```

You are no longer Escondida from a criatura if you don’t have Cobertura or
Encobrimento from them. If you use an Habilidade, interact with an inimigo,
Mover without sneaking, or otherwise make noise or reveal yourself
while Escondida, you are no longer Escondida once the activity that reveals
you resolves. For instance, if you are Escondida and then make a Golpe, you
resolve the Golpe first, then are no longer Escondida.

Searching for Escondida criaturas
You can Procurar for criaturas who are Escondida from you as long as those
criaturas are within 10 squares and you have Linha of Efeito to them. To
do so, you use a Manobra to make an Intuição Teste using the Procurar
Perícia, and qualquer Escondida criaturas within 10 squares of you each make
an opposed Agilidade Teste using the Esconder-se Perícia (see Opposed Poder Rolls
earlier in this chapter). At the Diretor’s discretion, different charac-
teristics and skills can be used in this opposed Teste. For example, your
foe Músculo make a Presença Teste using the Trato Animal Perícia to Esconder-se
among a flock of sheep without disturbing them, or you could make
a Razão Teste using the Bisbilhotar Perícia to pick out the breathing of a
criatura Escondida in the dark.

If the total of your Teste is higher than that of a Escondida criatura, they are
no longer Escondida from you. Otherwise, they remain Escondida from you.
As part of the Manobra used to Procurar Criaturas Escondidas, you can
point out qualquer criaturas you notice to aliados within 10 squares of you,
making those criaturas no longer Escondida from those aliados.

If a criatura is Escondida from your aliados but not from you, you can
use a Manobra without making a Teste to point that criatura out to
your aliados.

```
Sneaking
While you are Escondida from another criatura and not durante o Combate, you
can attempt to Furtivo—avoiding the senses of other criaturas as you
Mover around them in the Receptivo—to remain Escondida. While sneaking,
your Velocidade is halved. To Furtivo, you make an Agilidade Teste using the Furtivo
Perícia with a difficulty set by the Diretor. If you succeed, you remain
Escondida during your Movimento. This Teste can use another characteristic
at the Diretor’s discretion, such as using Presença to blend in with a
crowd on a packed city street.
```

```
What Does It Mean to Be Observed?
Most of the time, if a criatura has Linha of Efeito to you, they’re
able to observe you—especially if you’re an active threat to
them, such as in a Combate Encontro. However, the game leaves
what it means to be observed Receptivo to interpretation, because
there are circumstances where a criatura Músculo have Linha of
Efeito to you but isn’t observing you, giving you a chance to
Esconder-se. For example, a Guarda in a crowded marketplace likely
isn’t able to observe every criatura within their Linha of Efeito, so
slipping away to Esconder-se in that situation is probably easier than
hiding from them in an otherwise empty street. The Diretor
has the final say on who is observing you, and who you are
able to observe.

Group Tests
Whenever dois or more heroes attempt to overcome a single, simple
task together that calls for them to make the same Teste, the Diretor
can call for a Teste de Grupo. For example, if several heroes are all attempting
to Escalar the outside of a tower at the same time, giving each other
assistance and advice, they could be asked to make a Músculo Teste de Grupo.
If a group of heroes attempt to Furtivo by a sleeping Ogro, they Músculo
make an Agilidade Teste de Grupo.
```

**Teste de Grupo Difficulty**

```
The Diretor determines the difficulty of a Teste de Grupo the same way
they do for individual tests. Group tests can be easy, Médium, or hard.
```

```
Making a Teste de Grupo
Each Herói participating in the Teste de Grupo makes the Teste individually
as usual, but the Diretor waits until all the tests have been made to
interpret the outcome. A Herói who is participating in the Teste de Grupo
can’t assist another Herói participating in the Teste.
```

```
Teste de Grupo Outcome
When interpreting the outcome of a Teste de Grupo, the Diretor first
determines if the task succeeded or not before figuring out rewards
and consequences. If half or more of the heroes making the Teste de Grupo
succeed, then the Teste de Grupo succeeds. Otherwise, the Teste de Grupo fails.
```

```
If the heroes succeeded and half or more of them obtained a Recompensa
from the Teste, the Diretor gives the group a collective Recompensa and
ignores qualquer consequences incurred in the Teste. This collective Recompensa
should be equivalent to earning dois individual rewards. In fact, it could
be dois Consumível items, juicy pieces of information, or Herói tokens.
However, it could also be something more tailored to the task. For
instance, if the heroes earn a collective Recompensa while sneaking through
the camp of an inimigo army, the Diretor Músculo allow them to Sabotar
a bunch of Guerra engines or steal a few horses on their way out.
If the heroes failed the Teste de Grupo and more than half of them incurred
a consequence as a result, the Diretor gives the group a collective
consequence and ignores qualquer earned rewards. This collective
consequence should affect everyone. An easy option is for the stress of
failing the Teste to cause each Herói to take a Desvantagem on their next Poder
roll, or for the Diretor to gain 2 Malícia per Herói no começo of the
next Combate Encontro. But the consequence could also be tailored
to the task. For instance, if the heroes fail in their attempt to Furtivo
through the camp of an inimigo army, they’re spotted and the camp
immediately goes on alert as waves of inimigos attack them.
```

```
If fewer than half the heroes incur a consequence or earn a Recompensa on
their individual tests, then the Teste de Grupo simply succeeds or fails.
```

```

```

Montage Tests

When a group of heroes works together over time to accomplish
a common goal that requires more than a single characteristic, the
Diretor can call for a Teste de Montagem. Such tests typically take place
over a prolonged period and Foco on collective or shared activities.
Navigating a vast desert, convincing farmers to rise up against a
tyrannical Líder, and performing a ritual to Receptivo a magically sealed
gate can all be accomplished with montage tests.

In a Teste de Montagem, the jogadores take turns making tests as their
characters Ombrada a task together in a Teste de Montagem Ronda. Each Herói has
a chance to Fazer um Teste (or to assist another Herói’s Teste; see Auxiliar um Teste
above) intended to influence the outcome of the task.

A Herói can also Gastar their Turno using an item, Habilidade, or other
option they have available that they believe can help in the montage
Teste. For example, if a group of heroes want to cross an ocean on a
sailing ship before a Tempestade begins, um Herói Músculo make use of a
Magia fan that creates wind to keep the sails full day and night. The
Diretor decides that this clever action gives the heroes 2 automatic
successes in the Teste de Montagem, with no individual tests necessary (see
Total Successes and Failures below).

Once a Herói makes a Teste, assists with a Teste, or uses an Habilidade or
other option, they can’t do anything else as part of the Teste de Montagem
until each other Herói involved in the Teste de Montagem does so as well. A
Herói can also choose to do nothing, most often if they have no um to
assist and fear that their actions Músculo make the situation worse (see
Teste de Montagem Outcomes below). Once every Herói has had a chance to
act, the Teste de Montagem Ronda ends and a new um begins.

**Time and Stakes**

As the name suggests, montage tests create a kind of cinematic
montage in the action of the game. A Teste de Montagem can take place over
the course of several hours or days, with each individual Teste or other
activity set up as a brief vignette within the montage that stars um of
the heroes. Combate encounters, negotiations, and other challenges and
scenes can break up a Teste de Montagem (see Sample Teste de Montagem below).

The Diretor should deploy montage tests only when the jogadores are
engaged in overcoming a goal that has stakes for the story and some
sort of pressure, such as a looming deadline or impending harm. A
Teste de Montagem is great for a race to get to another location before an
inimigo army does, a chase to escape or catch up to a foe, weathering
a Perigo, preparing a village for Guerra, or similar activities. Low- or
no-stakes activities such as travel through a forest with no time
pressure, or training during a Descanso to use a new kit, can be narrated in
montage style, but they don’t require a Teste de Montagem.

**Diretor Sets the Scene**

no começo of a Teste de Montagem, the Diretor should describe the scenario
underlying the task at hand, and the various challenges the heroes
Músculo face as they attempt to collectively accomplish it. For example, if
the heroes are chasing down a pickpocket through a crowded market,
the Diretor Músculo talk about the throngs of innocent people Posicionamento de Palco
the way forward, obscuring the characters’ Visão, and making noise
that complicates attempts to hear the thief ’s Ligeiro footsteps. There
are also traveling carts to dodge, the Velocidade and dexterity of the pursued
personagem to contend with, and a Bando of stray dogs who chase after
anyone who sprints through the market. Describing these obstacles
gives the heroes ideas about what they’re trying to overcome as they
attempt to achieve their goals.

```
Individual Tests in Montage Tests
The difficulty of each individual Teste in a Teste de Montagem is set by the
Diretor and can vary from Teste to Teste. For instance, if the heroes are
preparing the defenses of a village threatened by a band of approaching
raiders, the Diretor Músculo decide that a personagem who wants to Cavar a
trench around the village needs to make an easy Músculo Teste. Another
Herói wants to train the untested farmers of the village in the ways of
Guerra, and the Diretor decides this is a hard Razão Teste.
```

```
The same rules and guidelines that apply to all individual tests apply
in montage tests. If a Herói has a clever, out-of-the-box idea that the
Diretor thinks should automatically succeed without rolling dice, it
does. If the circumstances of the Teste should grant an Vantagem or a Desvantagem,
they do. Individual Teste outcomes shouldn’t halt the story.
The Diretor should couch each Sucesso or Falha as it relates to the
overall goal of the Teste de Montagem. If the heroes are trying to Alcance an
ancient temple, failing a Músculo Teste to ford a river in their path doesn’t
mean they don’t cross the river and are stuck on the other side. But it
could mean that failing to cross the river in a timely manner gives a
Rival group of villains the chance to beat the party to the temple.
```

```
The rewards and consequences of individual tests made during a
Teste de Montagem are handled on an individual basis. The Diretor can use
the default of gaining additional Malícia in the next Combate Encontro
for consequences and having the party gain Herói tokens for rewards to
keep the montage moving.
```

```
Can’t Use the Same Perícia Twice
An individual personagem can’t use the same Perícia more than once in a
Teste de Montagem. Though multiple heroes can use the same Perícia, a Teste or
an assist with a specific Perícia represents each characters’ entire contri-
bution to the Teste de Montagem with that Perícia. At the Diretor’s discretion,
this restriction can be lifted for prolonged montage tests, or for montage
tests that are limited in scope and have only a small number of skills
that apply to them.
```

**New Challenges for Each Teste**

```
In general, when a Herói makes a Teste as part of a Teste de Montagem, they
should choose new obstacles to overcome that haven’t already been
overcome as part of the Teste. If the heroes are chasing a thief through
the marketplace and um of them has already Distraído the Bando of
stray dogs with a deft hand and a piece of meat, additional tests made to
distract the animals don’t count toward the outcome of the Teste de Montagem.
When it fits the scenario, the Diretor can adjust this restriction. If part
of a Teste de Montagem involves searching for people trapped in a Queimando
building, the Diretor is likely to allow multiple tests to fight or avoid the
Fogo, since this will happen throughout the Teste de Montagem, not just once.
```

```
Introducing More Challenges
During a Teste de Montagem, a Diretor can introduce new challenges for
the heroes to face. While attempting to run out of a Queimando building
from the top floor, the characters Músculo discover that by the time they
Alcance the second floor, beams are starting to fall and glass windows are
exploding as the structure starts to collapse. These new challenges can
be incorporated into the tests the heroes subsequently make.
```

Draw Steel

```
Sucesso Total
If the heroes earn a Sucesso Total, they achieve what they set out to do
without Complicação. For instance, if the heroes engaged in a montage
Teste to cross a desert and Alcance a city before a tyrant’s army arrives there
and levels the place, a Sucesso Total sees them arrive at the city gates
with plenty of time to warn people of the impending assault.
The heroes earn 1 Vitória when they achieve Sucesso Total on an easy
or moderate Teste de Montagem, and 2 Victories on a hard Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Sucesso Parcial
If the heroes earn a Sucesso Parcial, they succeed at what they set out
to do, but there is a Complicação or a cost involved. For instance, when
crossing the desert to Alcance and warn the city of the tyrant’s army,
a mixed Sucesso sees the characters arrive at the city gates with the
inimigo forces just behind them. Alternatively, the Diretor Músculo allow
the heroes to arrive well before the army, but they don’t Cobertura their
movements well enough. The tyrant realizes the city has been warned
and decides to call in a favor to have a powerful Dragão join the siege.
```

```
The heroes earn 1 Vitória when they achieve Sucesso Parcial on a hard
or moderate Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Falha Total
If the heroes suffer Falha Total, they don’t achieve what they set out
to do. Just as with standard tests, Falha on a Teste de Grupo shouldn’t bring
a story to a halt. Falha Total should make things more interesting and
challenging! With a Falha Total in a Teste de Montagem to cross the desert
and warn the city, the characters arrive at the city to find it already
under siege by the tyrant.
```

```
Sample Teste de Montagem
Four heroes must cross the vast and inhospitable Deserto Infinito
to warn the city of Ahset that the tyrannical Empress Vardo is
coming to conquer them. If the characters arrive in time, they can
organize the defenses of the city, giving its people a greater chance of
defeating the tyrant.
```

```
The Diretor determines that crossing the desert is a Teste de Montagem of
hard difficulty. With four heroes involved, the Limite de Sucesso is 6 and the
Limite de Falha is 2 as the Teste de Montagem begins.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Ronda 1
When the Teste begins, the Diretor sets the scene. They tell the jogadores
that the desert has extreme temperatures, sudden sandstorms, high
dunes to cross, deep sand, chasms, and Areia Movediça lakes. The Diretor
decides that the challenges of dunes, deep sand, and Areia Movediça can be
tackled multiple times in the Teste, since the Deserto Infinito is filled with
these hazards.
Urdoncara, a Fúria, starts things off by asking to make an Intuição Teste
using the Natureza Perícia to predict the best times of day to travel and
rest. She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert’s extreme
temperatures and qualquer sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so
that the journey is quickened. The Diretor decides this is an Teste Fácil.
Urdoncara makes the Teste and gets a total of 12, earning 1 Sucesso for
the Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Jorn, a Tático, wants to make a Razão Teste using the Escalar Perícia to
Liderar the party over dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The
Diretor allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes um
dune easier to Escalar than another is tricky, setting the difficulty at
hard. Jorn gets a 9 on the Teste and fails with a consequence, which the
Diretor decides will cause him to take a Desvantagem on his next Poder roll
due to the exertion. The Teste de Montagem has 1 Sucesso and 1 Falha.
```

```
Total Successes and Failures
The Diretor or another jogador will Rastrear the total number of successes
and failures the heroes earn during a Teste de Montagem. Every Teste de Montagem
has a Limite de Sucesso and a Limite de Falha. When the number of successful
tests equals the Limite de Sucesso, the Teste de Montagem ends and the heroes
achieve Sucesso Total (seeMontage Teste Outcomes below). The montage
Teste can also end when the number of failed tests equals the Falha
limit, and the heroes suffer Falha Total.
```

**Limited Rounds**

```
A Teste de Montagem should last only 2 Teste de Montagem rounds. If the heroes
don’t end the Teste de Montagem by achieving the Limite de Sucesso or Falha
limit, the Teste de Montagem ends when the second Teste de Montagem Ronda is
over. This time limit helps to keep a Teste de Montagem from becoming a
slog, and prevents heroes from simply using their turns to assist the
um Herói with the best chance of Sucesso. This can inspire each Herói to
be a more active participant in the Teste de Montagem. That said, the Diretor
can increase the number of rounds a Teste de Montagem lasts if they wish to
create a particularly grueling Desafio.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Difficulty
The Diretor determines the Limite de Sucesso and Limite de Falha of a montage
Teste. They can share this information or keep it secret, depending on
what feels the most fun and dramatic for the situation and the jogadores.
```

```
In general, the higher the Limite de Sucesso, the harder and more
complicated it is for the heroes to overcome the Teste de Montagem, since a
Herói can’t make the same Teste twice. The Teste de Montagem Difficulty table
gives a recommended Limite de Sucesso and Limite de Falha for easy, moderate,
and hard montage tests for groups with five heroes.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Difficulty
Difficulty Limite de Sucesso Limite de Falha
Easy 5 5
Moderate 6 4
Hard 7 3
```

```
For larger or smaller groups, the Diretor can make the following
adjustments to keep montage tests achievable but challenging:
```

```
¥ For four or fewer heroes, decrease the Limite de Sucesso and Falha limits
by 1 (to a minimum of 2) for every Herói fewer than five. For example,
if a group has only três heroes, an easy Teste de Montagem has a Sucesso
limit and Limite de Falha of 3.
¥ For six or more heroes, increase the Sucesso and Falha limits by 1 for
every Herói more than five.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Outcomes
A Teste de Montagem can have três different outcomes:
```

```
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Sucesso before hitting the Limite de Falha or
before the time runs out for the Teste, they achieve Sucesso Total.
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Falha or time runs out, and if they’ve
achieved at least dois more successes than failures, they achieve a
Sucesso Parcial.
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Falha or time runs out, and if they
don’t have at least dois more successes than failures, they suffer
Falha Total.
```

```
Tests
```

Karrel, an Elementalista, thinks the group Músculo cross the desert faster
if they have specially modified sandshoes that distribute their weight
and prevent their feet from sinking into the sand. The Diretor loves the
idea, and decides that making four pairs of the shoes while traveling the
desert is a Médium Razão Teste. Karrel gets to use their Alfaiataria Perícia
and winds up with a total of 13—a Sucesso com Consequência. The
Diretor decides to gain an additional 2 Malícia no começo of the next
Combate Encontro as a consequence, but the group now has 2 successes
and 1 Falha on the Teste de Montagem.

Val, a Conduíta, offers to Batedor ahead for the group with an Intuição
Teste, using the Navegação Perícia to find the best path forward and avoid
hazards such as chasms and Areia Movediça. The Diretor thinks that acting
as Vigia in a vast desert is an easy task. Val smashes it with a 21—a
Sucesso with a Recompensa—and the Diretor decides to get Criativa. Val’s
Vigia skills grant the next Herói to act in the Teste de Montagem an Vantagem on
their Teste. At the end of the first Teste de Montagem Ronda, the heroes have 3
successes and 1 Falha.

Interlude
Before the next Teste de Montagem Ronda, the Diretor pauses the montage
Teste to run a battle with a Minhoca das Fendas Real, who attacks the heroes as
they cross over an ancient ruin partially buried in the sand. After the
heroes defeat the Minhoca das Fendas Real, the Teste continues.

Teste de Montagem Ronda 2
Urdoncara wants to make a Músculo Teste using the Levantar Perícia to carry most
of the group’s Equipamento as they cross the desert, allowing her aliados
to Mover more quickly while she keeps up with her superior fortitude.
The Diretor thinks this arduous task has a hard difficulty. Urdoncara
gets a 17 on the Teste thanks to the Vantagem from Val’s earlier Sucesso. The
Teste de Montagem has 4 successes and 1 Falha.

Jorn, eager to prove himself after his last Falha, asks to make a Músculo
Teste using the Liderar Perícia, representing tying a rope around his waist to
drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The Diretor likes the
idea but doesn’t think the Liderar Perícia applies to the task. They tell Jorn
that Levantar is more appropriate, since the Tático is using his physical
Perícia to aid his friends and not really doing anything interpersonal. Jorn
agrees, and the Diretor sets the Teste at Médium difficulty. Making
the Teste with a Desvantagem because of his previous Falha, the Tático rolls
a 15, which is a Sucesso com Consequência. The Teste de Montagem has 5
successes and 1 Falha, but the consequence gives the Diretor another
2 Malícia no começo of the next Combate Encontro.

Since the group needs only um more Sucesso to achieve Sucesso Total,
Karrel says she’d like to assist Val in whatever task she decides to take
on. Val wants to Recolher lore about the Khem-hor—the inhabitants of
the Deserto Infinito—to remember their time-honored travel techniques
using the História Perícia. Karrel has the Cultura Perícia, which she can use
to assist by providing information about the lives and Sociedade of the
Khem-hor. She makes a Razão Teste to assist and gets a 16, granting Val
an Vantagem on her upcoming Teste.

Val attempts to Recolher lore about the Khem-hor, wanting to know if she
can remember qualquer of their travel from her studies of the História of the
region. The Diretor has her make a hard Razão Teste with an Vantagem,
thanks to Karrel’s input on the current state of Khem-hor Cultura. Val
gets a 17, and the Diretor decides that the Conduíta recalls a shortcut
through a canyon tunnel that leads directly to Ahset, avoiding a vast
lake of Areia Movediça. The heroes get their sixth Sucesso in the montage
Teste, achieving Sucesso Total, and earn 2 Victories.

```
Other Options
The heroes could have attempted other tests during their travels,
such as an Agilidade Teste using the Furtivo Perícia to Liderar the group through
dangerous shortcuts in the desert without being seen or waylaid by
predators, a Razão Teste using the Natureza Perícia to find enough food and
Água to keep the group hydrated and fed, or a Presença Teste using the
Música Perícia to inspire aliados to travel faster with song.
```

```
Combate
```

```
Chapter 10
```

```
Sides
Every Combate Encontro is a conflict between dois sides. The heroes
and qualquer of their aliados are um side, controlled by the jogadores. qualquer
criaturas who oppose the heroes are the other side, controlled by
the Diretor. All criaturas who oppose the heroes are on the same
side, even if those criaturas also oppose each other. For example, if
the heroes are battling a group of bandits when a Minhoca das Fendas Real
suddenly bursts into the fray to devour jogador characters and brigands
alike, the Minhoca is still on the side of the bandits for the purpose of the
game’s Combate rules.
```

```
Combate Ronda
Combate takes place over a series of Combate rounds. During a Combate
Ronda, each criatura in the battle takes a Turno. Once every criatura has
taken a Turno, a new Ronda begins.
```

**When Does Combate Start?**

```
Combate starts as soon as um criatura intends to harm another, or
when some environmental Efeito is in a position to deal dano to or
impose other negative effects on um or more criaturas. This means
that even before the action happens, a Herói can’t use a heroic Habilidade
without spending their Recurso Heróico on it, because Combate has
already begun!
```

# **Combate**

```
hen the heroes face a problem that can be solved only with
action, or when they come up against criaturas who want to
harm them, it’s time to Jogar down!
```

Set the Map

When Combate begins, the Diretor should position miniatures or
tokens on a gridded map to represent the Ambiente, the heroes,
their foes, and qualquer other criaturas in the battle.

**Tamanho and Space**

A criatura’s Tamanho indicates how many squares they occupy during
Combate, which defines the criatura’s space. If a criatura’s Tamanho is 1, they
occupy a space of 1 Quadrado. If a criatura is larger than 1 Quadrado, their
Tamanho equals the number of squares they take up in length, width, and
height. For example, a cavalo has a Tamanho of 2, which means that during
Combate, they occupy a space that is 2 squares long, 2 squares wide, and
2 squares high. You could also think of that space as a Cubo that is 2
squares on all sides.

The minimum amount of space a criatura can take up during Combate is
1 Quadrado, but Tamanho 1 criaturas can run the Alcance from tiny pixies to small
polders, Médium humans, and large Hakaan. As such, for criaturas of
Tamanho 1, that Tamanho is further broken down as 1PP, 1P, 1M, or 1G—abbrevia-
tions for tiny, small, Médium, and large. Tamanho 1PP is um Tamanho smaller than
Tamanho 1P, dois sizes smaller than 1M, três sizes smaller than 1G, and four
sizes smaller than Tamanho 2. If a mechanic mentions Tamanho 1 criaturas, that
mechanic applies to all criaturas of Tamanho 1.

objetos also have a Tamanho rating, which usually indicates how many
squares they occupy. Some objetos are identified as having an irregular
Tamanho, with that Tamanho instead representing the objeto’s mass and weight
relative to a criatura of the same Tamanho. If a mechanic mentions objetos of
a certain Tamanho, that mechanic includes all objetos of that Tamanho, including
irregular objetos.

The criatura Sizes table shows example sizes for criaturas up to Tamanho
5, but larger sizes are possible. There is no limit to what a criatura’s
Tamanho Músculo be.

```
NPC aliados
If an NPC aliado fights alongside the heroes, the Diretor should
give the jogadores the aliado’s Ficha de Criatura and let them control
the NPC during Combate. The Diretor has enough to worry
about. As well, qualquer missteps, mistakes, or triumphs the aliado
makes will be thanks to the decisions of the jogadores and not
the Diretor, which can make the outcome of the battle more
satisfying for the jogadores.
```

```
criatura Sizes
Tamanho Example criatura
1PP Pixie
1P Polder
1M Humano
1G Hakaan
2 Ogro
3 Arbusto Cambaleante
4 Gigante da Colina
5 Dragão de Agouro
How Big is a Quadrado?
It’s helpful to know how big a Quadrado is for abilities and features
that heroes and NPCs can use fora de Combate. By default,
a Quadrado is 5 feet on all sides. But the Diretor can change
this measurement to 2 yards, 2 meters, 1 meter, or qualquer other
measurement you prefer, as long as that scale stays consistent
throughout your game.
```

Draw Steel

```
Determine Surprise
When battle starts, the Diretor determines which criaturas, if qualquer, are
caught off Guarda. qualquer criatura who isn’t ready for Combate no começo
of an Encontro is Surpreso until the end of the first Combate Ronda. A
Surpreso criatura can’t take triggered actions or free triggered actions,
and Habilidade rolls made against them gain an Vantagem.
```

```
For example, if the heroes Furtivo up unnoticed on a camp of marauders
and attack, each Saqueador is Surpreso. Likewise, if the heroes fail to
notice that all the cloaked figures in a tavern are actually brain-de-
vouring zombies, then the heroes are Surpreso. If um of the heroes
notices the disguised Morto-Vivo before the zombies attack but has no
opportunity to warn their aliados, that Herói isn’t Surpreso but the rest of
the characters are.
```

```
Determine Who Goes First
Sometimes figuring out who gets to take the first Turno durante o Combate is
automatic. If all the criaturas on um side are Surpreso, then a criatura
on the other side gets to act first. But if both sides have criaturas who
aren’t Surpreso, the Diretor or a jogador they choose rolls a d10. On a 6
or higher, the jogadores determine who goes first—the heroes’ side or the
other side. Otherwise, the Diretor decides which side goes first.
```

```
criaturas Take Turns
Whichever side goes first chooses a criatura (or sometimes a group of
criaturas on the Diretor’s side) to act no começo of Combate. Whenever
the rules talk about a criatura acting durante o Combate, that criatura gets
to take their Turno. When that Turno is over, the other side chooses a
criatura to act. Play continues back and forth this way as each criatura
takes their Turno.
```

```
Unless an Habilidade or Especial rule allows them to do so, qualquer criatura who
has taken a Turno during a Combate Ronda can’t act De Novo until a new
Ronda begins. To help Rastrear which criaturas have already acted in the
current Ronda, each criatura can have a coin, token, or card they flip
over on the table, or some kind of flag they set on their virtual tabletop
token, once they’ve taken a Turno. That way, all the jogadores know who
has already acted and who hasn’t.
In many encounters, a point comes when um side has criaturas who
haven’t acted yet but all the criaturas on the other side have. The
criaturas who have yet to act get to take their turns in qualquer Ordem they
choose, without turns in between from the other side. For example,
consider four heroes taking on six inimigos. When all four heroes
have taken their turns and four of the inimigos have taken theirs,
the dois inimigos who are left take their turns um after the other to
end the Ronda.
```

```
Determining Who Acts Next
When it comes to the heroes’ side, the choice of who should act next is
intended to give jogadores the opportunity to comment, strategize, and
plan. Some tables, in some encounters, Músculo find that the choice of
who should act next isn’t obvious, Conduzindo to debate. That’s fine. Delib-
erating about what the group should do next is classic roleplaying.
```

```
In general, though, most groups find that it’s usually only um or dois
jogadores in a given Ronda who think it best if they act next. And as soon
as those jogadores explain why they want to act next and what they plan
on doing, the issue is quickly resolved.
```

```
Argumento Timer
If the jogadores do end up arguing in circles about what to do next, the
Diretor can place a timer on the discussion. Usually, giving the jogadores
a warning and 30 seconds to decide who goes next does the trick.
If they can’t choose by the end of that time, the Diretor chooses a
Herói to act.
```

```
Alternative Turno Ordem
If planning everyone’s Turno Ordem isn’t fun for your group, you
can leave it to the dice instead. no começo of Combate, have
each Herói, inimigo, and group of inimigos make an Agilidade Teste,
then record the totals. When it’s time for someone on the
heroes’ side to act, the Herói with the highest total goes first.
On the next Herói Turno, the Herói with the second-highest total
takes their Turno, and so on. The Diretor-controlled criaturas
act the same way. criaturas on the same side should reroll tied
Agilidade tests to determine who among the tied criaturas acts
before the others.
At the Diretor’s discretion, a Herói can swap their Turno in the
Ordem with another willing Herói no começo of a new Combate
Ronda. This allows certain abilities that interact with the
core Turno Ordem system, such as the Sombra’s Hesitation Is
Weakness Habilidade, to better work with this alternative system.
```

```
Combate
```

inimigos Act In Groups
Diretor-controlled criaturas act in groups, with information for
building groups found in _Draw Steel: Monsters_. When a group of
inimigos acts, the Diretor chooses a single criatura or Lacaio Esquadrão
to take a Turno. Once that Turno is over, the Diretor chooses another
criatura in that group to take a Turno, continuing until all members of
the group have taken their Turno.

**End of Ronda**

Once all criaturas on both sides of a battle have acted, the Combate
Ronda ends and a new Combate Ronda begins. The side whose
members acted first during the initial Combate Ronda goes first in all
subsequent rounds.

Agindo em seu Turno

Each criatura durante o Combate—whether Herói, adversary, or something in
between—gets to take a **Ação Principal** , a **Manobra** , and a **Ação de Movimento**
on their Turno (explained later in this chapter). Each combatant can
perform their Manobra and Ação Principal in qualquer Ordem, and can break up
the Movimento granted by their Ação de Movimento before, after, or between
their Manobra and Ação Principal however they like. You can also Turno
your Ação Principal into a Ação de Movimento or a Manobra, so that your Turno
can alternatively consist of dois Mover actions and a Manobra, or dois
maneuvers and a Ação de Movimento.

The Movimento section below breaks down how your Ação de Movimento
works, while the Maneuvers and Main Actions sections break
down the baseline maneuvers and main actions your personagem can
undertake. For qualquer activities not specifically covered in those rules,
such as cutting down a chandelier to drop on inimigos, the Diretor
decides whether such an activity is a Manobra or a Ação Principal.

**Triggered Actions and Free Triggered**

**Actions**

Your Herói Músculo have um or more unique triggered actions, each of
which has a specified Gatilho that allows the action to be used. You
can use um Reação per Ronda, either on your Turno or another
criatura’s Turno, but only when the action’s Gatilho occurs. For instance,
a Fúria Herói can use the Linhas de Força Reação to force Mover a
alvo, but only after an inimigo has first tried to force Mover the Fúria or
another nearby criatura.

A Reação Livre follows the same rules as a Reação, but
it doesn’t count against your limit of um Reação per Ronda. For
instance, a Sombra Herói can use their Hesitar é Fraqueza Habilidade to
take their Turno in response to the Gatilho of another Herói ending their
Turno. But because that Habilidade is a Reação Livre, the Sombra can
still use their No Meio da Confusão Reação later in the Ronda.

If multiple triggered actions occur in response to the same Gatilho, qualquer
heroes and other jogador-controlled criaturas taking a Reação
or a Reação Livre decide among themselves which of those
triggered actions are resolved first. Then the Diretor decides the same
for criaturas they control.

qualquer Efeito that prevents you from using triggered actions also prevents
you from using free triggered actions.

```
Free Maneuvers
Boring stuff like opening an unlocked door, picking up an arrow from the
Chão, giving an objeto to an Adjacente aliado, or drawing a Arma doesn’t
require a Manobra or a Ação Principal. Rather, you can undertake such
straightforward activities as free maneuvers on your Turno. A Manobra Livre
follows the same rules as a regular Manobra, but you can typically take as
many free maneuvers as you like.
```

```
At the Diretor’s discretion, circumstances could make something that is
typically boring more impactful and exciting. For instance, if you need to
pick a Magia arrow up off the Chão during a violent earthquake, what
would otherwise be a Manobra Livre could require a Manobra or a main
action to accomplish.
Likewise, the Natureza of an activity Músculo make it too complicated for a free
Manobra. For example, picking up the body of an Inconsciente Talento aliado
to carry them to safety can probably be done as a Manobra Livre. But if
your Músculo is lacking and you need to pick up a Tático aliado decked out
in the Armadura Brilhante kit, the Diretor Músculo determine that you need to
use a regular Manobra to hoist their armored form over your shoulders.
```

```
qualquer Efeito that prevents you from using maneuvers also prevents you
from using free maneuvers.
```

```
No-Action Activities
Free maneuvers Cobertura most of the simple activities you Músculo want
to undertake on your Turno. When it isn’t your Turno, you can typically
undertake even simpler activities requiring no action with the Diretor’s
approval. For instance, shouting out a warning to an aliado or dropping an
item so another criatura can pick it up require no action.
```

```
The Diretor can limit what kinds of no-action activities you can attempt
when it isn’t your Turno. For instance, shouting out a warning about an
unseen foe to an aliado on the aliado’s or the foe’s Turno requires no action.
But the Diretor Músculo stop you from giving that aliado complex tactical
advice when it isn’t your Turno, saying that doing so instead requires a free
Manobra on your Turno.
```

```
Movimento
During Combate, criaturas can employ multiple Mecânica that allow
them to Mover around the battlefield. The most common of those
Mecânica is the Avançar or Retirar-se Ação de Movimento (detailed under
Mover Actions below), but abilities granted by your Classe, Equipamento,
Linhagem, Título, or other options Músculo allow you other ways to Mover.
```

```
Your Herói starts with a Velocidade granted by their Linhagem—usually 5. This
represents the maximum number of squares you can Mover when you
take the Ação de Movimento or when another Efeito allows you to Mover. Your
Velocidade can be increased by your kit and other game options.
All squares Adjacente to your personagem cost 1 Movimento to Mover into. No,
there’s no Pythagorean theorem on the grid. It’s a game, don’t overthink it.
```

```
Your Herói can Mover freely through an aliado’s space. You can Mover through
an inimigo’s space, but that space is Terreno Difícil (see below). You can’t
stop moving in qualquer other criatura’s space, including to make a Golpe or use
a Ação Principal or Manobra while in that space and then continuing your
Mover, unless that criatura’s Tamanho is dois or more sizes greater or smaller
than your own.
At the Diretor’s discretion, you can be forced into the same space as
another criatura whose Tamanho is within 1 of yours, such as by Caindo down
a narrow shaft with such a criatura already at the bottom. When you are
squeezed into the same space as another criatura whose Tamanho is within 1 of
yours, your Habilidade rolls and tests take a Desvantagem.
```

Draw Steel

```
Can’t Exceed Velocidade
A single Mover or other Efeito can never allow a criatura to Mover
more squares than their Velocidade, unless the Efeito states otherwise. For
example, a criatura with Velocidade 5 Músculo have that Velocidade reduced to 2
by the Lento Condição (see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes). If an
aliado then alvos them with an Efeito that allows them to Mover up to
3 squares, the criatura can Mover only 2 squares because that’s their
current Velocidade.
```

**Can’t Cut Corners**

```
A criatura can’t Mover diagonally when doing so would involve passing
through the corner of a Parede or some other objeto that completely fills
the corner between the criatura’s space and the space they are moving
to. This rule applies only to moving past objetos, not moving past
other criaturas.
```

```
Cut Corners
The Tático moves 3 squares to exit the building without
cutting corners. The Cão de Guerra Eviscerita can’t Mover around the
side of the building in just 2 squares of Movimento, since they’d
have to cut a corner to do so.
```

**Shifting**

```
Shifting is a careful form of Movimento that allows a criatura to Mover
safely past dangerous foes. Certain abilities, features, and other rules
allow you to Ajustar-se a specific number of squares, sometimes up to your
Velocidade. Whenever you Ajustar-se, criaturas can’t make opportunity attacks
against you triggered by that Movimento (see Opportunity Attacks later
in this chapter).
You can’t Ajustar-se into or while within Terreno Difícil or Terreno Danoso
(see below). If a rule allows you to Ajustar-se, you can choose to instead Mover
up to the number of squares you would have shifted (for example, to
get out of Terreno Difícil). However, you can’t combine moving and
shifting within that Movimento.
```

**Movimento Types**

```
criaturas in the game can use eight types of Movimento: Andar, Escavar,
Escalar, Nadar, Pular, Rastejar, Voar, and Teleportar-se.
```

```
Andar
Walking is the most common Movimento Tipo, whether it refers to
ambulating on legs, rolling, slithering, or some other default method
of Movimento. Unless specified otherwise, all criaturas can Mover over
solid horizontal Chão without qualquer problem.
```

```
Escavar
A criatura who has “Escavar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to Escavar, can Mover through dirt horizontally, and
either has the means to breathe while doing so or doesn’t require Ar
to live. Such criaturas can’t Mover through more solid Chão, such as
Pedra, unless their Ficha de Criatura or the Efeito that lets them Escavar says
otherwise. Similarly, a Escavador criatura doesn’t leave a tunnel unless
the rules say so.
Cavar Manobra
It takes extra effort to Cavar vertically through the Chão as opposed to
tunneling horizontally, requiring a criatura to use a Especial Manobra. To
use the Cavar Manobra, a criatura must have “Escavar” in their Velocidade entry,
they must have a Velocidade that is equal to or greater than their Tamanho, and they
must be touching terrain that can be burrowed through.
```

```
When a criatura uses the Cavar Manobra, they can Mover vertically up to a
number of squares equal to their Tamanho. If a Escavador criatura has a criatura
who is not Inconsciente Agarrado, they can’t willingly Mover deeper into the
Chão. It’s too difficult to Cavar with a flailing inimigo in your Garras.
Targeting Escavador criaturas
If you are on the Chão, you have Linha of Efeito to a Escavador criatura if
that criatura occupies 1 or more squares of terrain that can be burrowed
through and that touch the Chão, and if you have Linha of Efeito to qualquer of
those squares. The Escavador criatura gains the Benefício of Cobertura from you.
```

```
If you are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador, you don’t have
Linha of Efeito to qualquer criatura on the surface unless a rule states otherwise.
If you are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador and are
Adjacente to another criatura who is Escavador, you have Linha of Efeito to
that criatura, though you both have Cobertura from each other.
```

```
You can’t gain the Benefício of high Chão (see below) against criaturas who
are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador.
Non-Escavador criaturas
If you are on the Chão and Adjacente to a criatura who is beneath the
Chão while Escavador, you can use a Manobra to Puxar that criatura
up 1 Quadrado out of the Chão, provided the criatura is willing.
```

```
If a criatura who can’t Escavar wants to Cavar into the Chão, they can
use the following Habilidade provided their Velocidade is 2 or more.
```

```
Cavoucar
— Manobra
e Personagem x Personagem
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo :
á You can Mover 1 Quadrado into, out of, or through Chão you are
touching that can be burrowed through, and you are Lento
and Enfraquecido (FdT).
é You can use your Ação Principal this Turno to Mover 1 Quadrado
into, out of, or through Chão you are touching that can be
burrowed through, and you are Lento (FdT).
í You can Mover 1 Quadrado into, out of, or through Chão you are
touching that can be burrowed through.
```

```
Escavador Movimento Forçado
While a criatura who is completely beneath the Chão while
Escavador is force moved by Movimento that isn’t Vertical, they aren’t
moved, and they take 1 dano for each Quadrado they would have been
force moved. If the Movimento Forçado is Vertical, the criatura is moved
through the dirt as is if were Ar.
```

```
Combate
```

Escalar or Nadar
A criatura who has “Escalar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to automatically Escalar, can Escalar across Vertical and
horizontal surfaces at full Velocidade. Likewise, a criatura who has “Nadar” in
their Velocidade entry, or who gains the temporary Habilidade to automatically
Nadar, can Nadar in liquid at full Velocidade.

criaturas without those types of Movimento can still Escalar or Nadar
when a rule allows them to Mover, but each Quadrado of Escalador or
Nadador costs 2 squares of Movimento. If a surface is difficult to Escalar
(for instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered Parede) or a liquid is hard to Nadar
through (a raging river or whirlpool), the Diretor can call for a Músculo Teste.
On a Falha, a criatura can’t Escalar or Nadar but wastes no Movimento in
the attempt. The Diretor can also impose other consequences to Falha,
such as being caught in the spinning current of a whirlpool.

**Escalador Other criaturas**
You can attempt to Escalar a criatura whose Tamanho is greater than yours. If
the criatura is willing, you can Escalar them without qualquer trouble. If the
criatura is unwilling, you make the following Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You fail to Escalar the criatura, and they can make a Golpe Simples
against you.
é You fail to Escalar the criatura.
í You Escalar the criatura.
```

While you Escalar or Montar a criatura, you gain an Vantagem on Corpo-a-corpo abilities
used against them. The criatura can use a Manobra to attempt to
knock you off, forcing you to make the following Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You fall off the criatura into an unoccupied Adjacente space of
your choice, taking Caindo dano and landing Derrubado as usual
(see Caindo below).
é You Deslizar down the criatura into an unoccupied Adjacente
space of your choice and don’t land Derrubado.
í You continue to hold on to the criatura.
```

If you are knocked Derrubado while Escalador or riding a criatura, you fall
and land Derrubado in an Adjacente space of your choice, taking dano as
usual from the fall.

Pular
Whenever an Efeito allows you to Mover (including using the Avançar
Ação de Movimento), you can automatically long Pular a number of squares up
to your Músculo or Agilidade score (your choice; minimum 1 Quadrado) as part
of that Movimento. The height of your Pular is automatically 1 Quadrado as
part of that Movimento.

If you want to Pular even longer or higher than your baseline Pular
allows, make a Músculo or Agilidade Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You don’t Pular qualquer farther than your baseline Pular allows.
é You Pular 1 Quadrado longer and higher than your baseline Pular
allows.
í You Pular 2 squares longer and higher than your baseline
Pular allows.
```

You can’t Pular farther or higher than the Distância of the Efeito that
allows you to Mover. You can’t Pular out of Terreno Difícil or damaging
terrain (see below).

```
Rastejar
If you are Derrubado (see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes), you can remain
Derrubado and Rastejar on the Chão. Doing so costs you 1 additional Quadrado
of Movimento for every Quadrado you Rastejar. If you intentionally want to
Rastejar, you can fall Derrubado as a Manobra Livre. While voluntarily Derrubado,
you can choose to stand as a Manobra Livre.
```

```
F ly
A criatura who has “Voar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to Voar, can Mover through the Ar vertically or horizon-
tally at full Velocidade and remain in midair. If a flying criatura is knocked
Derrubado or has their Velocidade reduced to 0, they fall (see Caindo below).
```

```
Pairar
A criatura who has “Pairar” in their Velocidade entry (most commonly
alongside “Voar” or “Teleportar-se”), or who gains the temporary Habilidade to
Pairar, can remain motionless in midair. They don’t fall even if they are
knocked Derrubado or their Velocidade is reduced to 0.
```

```
Teleportar-se
When a criatura teleports, they Mover from um space to another space
instantaneously. The following rules apply to teleporting:
¥ Teleporting doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks or other effects that
are triggered by a criatura moving.
¥ When a criatura teleports, they bypass qualquer obstacles between the
space they leave and their destination space.
¥ A criatura teleporting themself must have Linha of Efeito to their
destination space. A criatura teleporting another criatura must have
Linha of Efeito from the space the teleported criatura leaves and to
their destination space.
¥ A teleporting criatura’s destination space can’t be occupied by
another criatura or objeto.
¥ The Efeito that lets a criatura Teleportar-se indicates how far they can
Teleportar-se. That Distância can be greater than the criatura’s Velocidade.
¥ If a criatura can Teleportar-se as part of their usual Movimento, they can
use the Avançar Ação de Movimento to Teleportar-se a number of squares up to
their usual Velocidade, unmodified by conditions or effects.
¥ If a criatura teleports while Derrubado, they can be standing when they
Alcance their destination space provided they are able to stand. If a
Derrubado criatura is teleported by another criatura, it is up to that
criatura whether the teleported criatura remains Derrubado or stands if
they are able.
¥ If you Teleportar-se while affected by the Agarrado or Imobilizado conditions,
those conditions end for you.
¥ When a criatura teleports, they must leave the space where they
start and enter a new space. A criatura can’t Teleportar-se to and from
the same space.
```

**Caindo**

```
When a criatura falls 2 or more squares and lands on the Chão, they
take 2 dano for each Quadrado they fall (to a maximum of 50 dano)
and land Derrubado. A criatura who falls can reduce the effective height
of the fall by a number of squares equal to their Agilidade score (to a
minimum of 0). Caindo into liquid that is 1 Quadrado or more deep reduces
the effective height of a fall by 4 squares (to a minimum of 0).
Caindo is not Movimento Forçado, but being force moved downward is
considered Caindo (see Caindo below). Movimento from Caindo doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks (see Opportunity Attacks below).
```

Draw Steel

```
Caindo Onto Another criatura
A criatura who falls and lands on another criatura causes that criatura
to take the same dano from the fall. The Caindo criatura then lands
Derrubado in the nearest quadrado desocupado of their choice. If the Caindo
criatura’s Tamanho is greater than the Músculo score of the criatura they land
on, that criatura is knocked Derrubado.
```

```
Caindo Far
When a criatura first falls from a great height, they fall 100 squares in
the first Ronda. At the end of each subsequent Ronda that they remain
Caindo, they fall another 100 squares.
```

```
Terreno Difícil
Areas of thick underbrush, rubble, spiderwebs, or other obstacles
to Movimento create Terreno Difícil. It costs 1 additional Quadrado of
Movimento to enter a Quadrado of Terreno Difícil.
```

**Terreno Danoso**

```
Areas of Ácido, Fogo, sharp rocks, lava, or qualquer other terrain that causes
dano to criaturas within it is Terreno Danoso. The dano dealt
by Terreno Danoso is noted in the terrain’s description or in the
description of the Efeito that creates the terrain.
High Chão
Whenever a criatura uses an Habilidade to alvo a criatura or objeto while
standing on the Chão and occupying a space that is fully above the
alvo’s space, they gain an Vantagem on the Poder roll against that alvo. To
be fully above a alvo, the bottom of a criatura’s space must be higher
than or bordering on the top of the alvo’s space.
```

```
A criatura can gain this Benefício while Escalador only if they have
“Escalar” in their Velocidade entry or can automatically Escalar at full Velocidade
while moving.
```

```
Movimento Forçado
Some actions and maneuvers allow a criatura to Empurrar, Puxar, or Deslizar a
alvo criatura or objeto a specific Distância across the battlefield. Collec-
tively, these types of Movimento are called Movimento Forçado.
```

```
Empurrar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares away from
them in a straight Linha, without moving them vertically. Each
Quadrado the criatura moves the alvo must put the alvo farther
away from them.
Puxar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares toward them
in a straight Linha, without moving them vertically. Each Quadrado the
criatura moves the alvo must bring the alvo closer to them.
Deslizar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares in qualquer Direção,
except for vertically. Unlike a Empurrar or a Puxar, a Deslizar doesn’t need to
be a straight Linha.
When you force Mover a alvo, you can always Mover that alvo fewer
squares than the number indicated. For example, when the Conduíta
obtains a Grau 3 “Empurrar 3” outcome with their Invocar o Trovão
Habilidade, they can Empurrar alvos qualquer Distância up to 3 squares, including
choosing to not Mover certain alvos at all.
```

```
Movimento Forçado ignores Terreno Difícil and never provokes
opportunity attacks. When you force Mover a alvo into damaging
terrain or into terrain that produces an Efeito, they are affected as if they
had moved into it willingly.
```

```
Terreno Difícil
A Fúria with Velocidade 6 takes the Avançar Ação de Movimento across
a field with Água and bushes that create Terreno Difícil
(indicated by the blue squares on the map). Each highlighted
path indicates how many squares of Movimento they must
use while moving through or avoiding difficulty terrain. Their
Movimento can’t exceed 6 squares.
```

```
High Chão
The Talento stands atop a 3-Quadrado-high tower, which is higher
than qualquer other criatura. They gain an Vantagem on all Poder rolls
made against their inimigos in the diagram. The Goblin Assassino
and Cão de Guerra Comando stand on structures that are 2 squares
high. They gain an Vantagem on Habilidade rolls against the Tático,
who is standing on the Chão, but not against the Talento.
```

```
Combate
```

Vertical
If a Movimento Forçado Efeito has the word “Vertical” in front of it, then
the Movimento Forçado can Mover a alvo up or down in addition to hor-
izontally. For example, if a Movimento Forçado Efeito says “Vertical Empurrar
5,” then a criatura targeted by the Efeito can be pushed up to 5 squares
in qualquer Direção, as long as the Movimento Forçado is a straight Linha.

If a criatura who can’t Voar is left in midair at the end of a Vertical forced
Mover, they fall. Movimento Forçado made against a criatura who is flying
is always a Vertical forced Mover, whether or not the Efeito specifies it.

Though you can’t freely Empurrar, Puxar, or Deslizar a alvo up and down unless
that Movimento Forçado specifies “Vertical,” you can Mover them along a
physical slope such as a hill or staircase. For a alvo to be force moved
along a slope, each Quadrado of the slope can be no more than 1 Quadrado
higher or lower than the previous Quadrado.

Big Versus Little
When a larger criatura force moves a smaller alvo with a Corpo-a-corpo
Arma Habilidade, the Distância of the Movimento Forçado is increased by 1.
If a smaller criatura force moves a larger alvo with a Corpo-a-corpo Arma
Habilidade, the Distância doesn’t change.

Slamming into criaturas
When you force Mover a criatura into another criatura, the Movimento
ends and both criaturas take 1 dano for each Quadrado remaining in
the first criatura’s Movimento Forçado. You can also force Mover an objeto
into a criatura. The objeto’s Movimento ends, and the criatura takes 1
dano for each Quadrado remaining in the objeto’s Movimento Forçado.

```
It’s possible to Mover a criatura or objeto of a larger Tamanho into several
criaturas of a smaller Tamanho at the same time. When this happens, the
larger criatura in the collision takes dano only once, not once for
each smaller criatura they slam into.
```

```
If a criatura is killed by dano from an Habilidade or Efeito that also
force moves them, a second criatura they are slammed into still takes
dano unless the Diretor deems otherwise.
You can force Mover another criatura into yourself with a Puxar or a Deslizar.
```

```
Slamming Into criaturas
The Nulo slides a Cão de Guerra Comando 5 squares. The Nulo force
moves the Comando 1 Quadrado and then slams them into
another Adjacente Comando. The Movimento Forçado ends, and
both commandos take 4 dano, since the Movimento Forçado
still had 4 squares remaining when the commandos collided.
```

```
Movimento Forçado
The Fúria pushes a Cão de Guerra Comando 2 squares. The Censurador
pulls a Comando 2 squares. The Elementalista slides a
Comando 2 squares. Each Comando can end up anywhere
in the indicated Área of their Movimento Forçado on the diagram.
```

```
Vertical Movimento Forçado
The Talento verically slides the Goblin Corta-Espinhas 3 squares up
into the Ar and off of a cliff. The Goblin falls 5 squares, taking 10
dano and landing Derrubado from the fall.
```

```
Multitarget Abilities and Movimento Forçado
Some criaturas can force Mover multiple criaturas or objetos
with a single Habilidade. Unless the Habilidade specifies otherwise, the
criatura using the Habilidade determines the Ordem in which the
alvos are force moved. The criatura should select each alvo
individually and complete their Movimento Forçado before force
moving the next alvo affected.
```

Draw Steel

```
Slamming Into objetos
When a criatura force moves a alvo into a stationary objeto that is
the alvo’s Tamanho or larger and the objeto doesn’t break (see below), the
Movimento ends and the alvo takes 2 dano plus 1 dano for each
Quadrado remaining in their Movimento Forçado.
If you force Mover a criatura downward into an objeto that doesn’t
break (including the Chão), they also take Caindo dano as if they
had fallen the Distância force moved and their Agilidade score was 0 (see
Caindo above).
```

```
Arremesável Through objetos
When you Mover a criatura into a Mundano objeto, the objeto can break
depending on how many squares of Movimento Forçado remain. The cost
of being slammed into an objeto is tied to the dano a alvo takes for
being hurled through it:
¥ It costs 1 remaining Quadrado of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of glass. The criatura moved takes 3 dano.
¥ It costs 3 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of wood. The criatura moved takes 5 dano.
¥ It costs 6 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of Pedra. The criatura moved takes 8 dano.
¥ It costs 9 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of metal. The criatura moved takes 11 dano.
```

```
If qualquer Movimento Forçado remains after the objeto is destroyed, you can
continue to Mover the criatura who destroyed the objeto.
```

```
Forced Into a Fall
If you can’t Voar and are force moved across an Receptivo space that would
cause you to fall, such as being pushed over the Vantagem of a cliff, you
continue moving the total Distância you were moved first. If you are still
in a position to fall when the foced Movimento ends, you fall.
```

```
Estabilidade
Each criatura has a Estabilidade that allows them to resist forced
Movimento. When a criatura is force moved, they can reduce that
Movimento up to a number of squares equal to their Estabilidade. Heroes
start with Estabilidade 0 and can increase their Estabilidade through Linhagem,
Classe, and kit options.
A criatura’s Estabilidade can’t be less than 0, even when reduced
by a Penalidade.
```

```
“When a criatura Moves ...”
Certain abilities and effects Gatilho when a criatura moves into a
particular Área. Movimento Forçado triggers these options unless
otherwise noted, including an Efeito stating that a criatura must
willingly Mover to Gatilho it.
```

```
Morte Effects and Movimento Forçado
Some criaturas have traits or abilities that Gatilho when they die or
are reduced to 0 Vigor. If such a criatura is reduced to 0 Vigor by
dano from an Habilidade or Efeito that also force moves them, the forced
Movimento takes place before the triggered Efeito.
```

Mover Actions

```
A Ação de Movimento allows a criatura to Mover around the battlefield.
Sometimes you’ll already be exactly where you want to be so that you
don’t need to use a Ação de Movimento on your Turno. That’s okay! The decision
to not Mover is just as tactical as the decision to Mover.
```

```
Avançar
When a criatura takes the Avançar Ação de Movimento, they Mover a number
of squares up to their Velocidade. They can break up this Movimento with
their Manobra and Ação Principal however they wish.
```

**Retirar-se**

```
When a criatura takes the Retirar-se Ação de Movimento, they can Ajustar-se 1
Quadrado. Certain Classe features, kits, and other rules allow a criatura
to Ajustar-se more than 1 Quadrado when they Retirar-se. A criatura who
does so can break up their Ajustar-se with their Manobra and Ação Principal
however they wish.
```

```
Montar
A criatura can take the Montar Ação de Movimento only while mounted on
another criatura (see Mounted Combate below). When a criatura
takes the Montar Ação de Movimento, they cause their Montaria to Mover up to the
Montaria’s Velocidade, taking the rider with them. Alternatively, a criatura can
use the Montar Ação de Movimento to have their Montaria use the Retirar-se Mover
action as a Reação Livre. A criatura can use the Montar Ação de Movimento
only once per Ronda. A mounted criatura can only have this Mover
action applied to them once per Ronda. This Movimento can be broken
up with the rider’s Manobra and Ação Principal however they wish.
```

```
Arremesável Through objetos
The Nulo slides a Cão de Guerra Comando 5 squares. The Nulo force
moves the Comando 1 Quadrado and then slams them into a
thick wooden Parede. The Nulo forces the Comando through the
first Quadrado of the Parede by using 3 squares of Movimento Forçado,
resulting in the Comando taking 5 dano. The Comando
still has 1 Quadrado of Movimento Forçado left, so they are pushed
into the next Quadrado of the Parede, which doesn’t break but does
result in the Comando’s forced moment ending and them
taking another 3 dano: 1 for the Quadrado of Movimento Forçado
leftover and 2 for colliding with an objeto.
```

```
Tracking objeto Forced-Movimento dano
At the Diretor’s discretion, Mundano objetos that are force
moved into criaturas or other objetos take dano as if they
were criaturas. Sturdy objetos can take dano as follows
before they are destroyed:
¥ Wood objeto: 3 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
¥ Pedra objeto: 6 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
¥ Metal objeto: 9 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
More fragile objetos are destroyed after taking qualquer dano.
```

Maneuvers

A Manobra typically involves less Foco and exertion than a Ação Principal
(see below). It can be an opportunity to Mover other criaturas, drink a
potion, or undertake similar activities.

Sometimes you Músculo not have anything you can do with your Manobra.
That’s totally fine! Often, the best thing to do on your Turno is take a main
action and Mover on.

**Auxiliar Ataque**

A criatura who uses the Auxiliar Ataque Manobra chooses an inimigo Adjacente
to them. The next Habilidade roll an aliado makes against that inimigo before the
start of the aiding criatura’s next Turno gains an Vantagem.

**Recuperar Fôlego**

A criatura who uses the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra spends a Recuperação and
regains Vigor equal to their Recuperação value. (See below for Vigor. See
Recoveries in Chapter 1: The Basics.)

A criatura who is Morrendo (see Morrendo and Morte in Vigor below) can’t
use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra, but other criaturas can help them Gastar
Recoveries in other ways.

**Escapar Agarrão**

A criatura who is Agarrado by another criatura, an objeto, or an Efeito (see
Agarrar below) can attempt to escape by using the following Habilidade.

```
Escapar Agarrão
— Manobra
e Personagem x Personagem
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á No Efeito.
é You can escape the Agarrar, but if you do, a criatura who has you
Agarrado can make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against you before you
are no longer Agarrado.
í You are no longer Agarrado.
Efeito: You take a Desvantagem on this Manobra if your Tamanho is smaller than
the Tamanho of the criatura, objeto, or Efeito that has you Agarrado.
```

See Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes for information on the
Agarrado Condição.

**Agarrar**

A criatura tentando to keep a foe close and locked down can attempt to
Agarrar a criatura using the following Habilidade.

```
Agarrar
Corpo-a-corpo, Arma Manobra
e Corpo-a-corpo 1 x um criatura
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo :
á No Efeito.
é You can Agarrar the alvo, but if you do, the alvo can make a
Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against you before they are Agarrado.
í The alvo is Agarrado by you.
Efeito: You can usually alvo only criaturas of your Tamanho or smaller.
If your Músculo score is 2 or higher, you can alvo qualquer criatura with a
Tamanho equal to or less than your Músculo score.
```

Unless otherwise indicated, a criatura can Agarrar only um criatura at a time.

See Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes for information on the
Agarrado Condição.

```
Esconder-se
Using the Esconder-se Manobra, a criatura attempts to Esconder-se from other
criaturas who aren’t observing them while they have Cobertura or
Encobrimento. See Esconder-se and Furtivo in Chapter 9: Tests for full details.
```

```
Empurrar
A criatura wanting to Empurrar an Adjacente criatura away from them can
attempt to shove that criatura using the following Habilidade.
```

```
Empurrar
Corpo-a-corpo, Arma Manobra
e Corpo-a-corpo 1 x 1 criatura
```

```
Poder Roll + M ight:
á Empurrar 1
é Empurrar 2
í Empurrar 3
Efeito: You can usually alvo only criaturas of your Tamanho or smaller.
If your Músculo score is 2 or higher, you can alvo qualquer criatura with a
Tamanho equal to or less than your Músculo score.
```

```
Hiding
To become Escondida, the Sombra can’t be observed by the Guerra
dog Crucibita, so they must get out of the Crucibita’s Linha of
Efeito. In this situation, the Sombra could do this by moving to
put a Parede between them and the Crucibita or moving up onto
a roof.
```

Draw Steel

```
Make or Auxiliar um Teste
Many tests are maneuvers if made durante o Combate. Searching a chest with
a Razão Teste, picking a door’s lock with an Agilidade Teste, or lifting a
portcullis with a Músculo Teste would all be maneuvers. Assisting a Teste is
also a Manobra durante o Combate (see Auxiliar um Teste in Chapter 9: Tests).
```

```
Complex or time-consuming tests Músculo require a Ação Principal if
made durante o Combate—or could take so long that they can’t be made during
Combate at all. Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Razão Teste
to Recolher lore about mummies, are usually free maneuvers durante o Combate.
The Diretor has the final say regarding which tests can be made
as maneuvers.
```

```
Procurar Criaturas Escondidas
The Procurar Criaturas Escondidas Manobra allows a criatura to
attempt to locate criaturas Escondida from them (see Esconder-se and Furtivo in
Chapter 9: Tests).
```

**Levantar**

```
A criatura can use the Levantar Manobra to Levantar if they are
Derrubado, ending that Condição. Alternatively, they can use this Manobra
to make a willing Adjacente Derrubado criatura Levantar.
```

```
Usar Consumível
Unless otherwise noted in its description, a criatura can Ativar
a Consumível Tesouro such as a potion with the Usar Consumível
Manobra. A criatura can use this Manobra to administer a
Consumível Tesouro that benefits the user either to themself or to a
willing Adjacente criatura. See Consumables in Chapter 13: Rewards.
```

Main Actions

```
When you take a Ação Principal, you most often do so to use a unique
Habilidade granted by your Classe, kit, or a Tesouro (see Abilities in
Chapter 5: Classes). These abilities represent the most unique, flavorful,
and impactful things you can do with your Ação Principal.
You can also use your Ação Principal to catch your Sopro, help another
criatura regain Vigor, Investir into battle, Defensor yourself, or make a
Golpe Simples.
```

```
You can convert your Ação Principal into a Manobra or a Ação de Movimento,
allowing you to take dois maneuvers or Mover actions on your Turno.
```

```
Investir
When a criatura takes the Investir Ação Principal, they Mover up to their
Velocidade in a straight Linha, then make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples (see Free Strikes
below) against a alvo when they end their Mover. If the criatura has an
Habilidade with the Investir Palavra-Chave, they can use that Habilidade against the
alvo instead of a Golpe Simples.
```

```
A criatura can’t Mover through Terreno Difícil or Ajustar-se when they
Investir. They can Voar or Escavar as part of the Investir Ação Principal if they
have that Movimento available to them, but they can’t Escalar or Nadar
while charging unless they can automatically use that Movimento
at full Velocidade.
```

```
Defensor
When a criatura takes the Defensor Ação Principal, Habilidade rolls made
against them have a double Desvantagem até o início do seu próximo turno.
Additionally, you have a double Vantagem on tests when called for to resist
environmental effects or a criatura’s traits or abilities. A criatura gains
no Benefício from this action while another criatura is Provocado by them
(see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes).
```

**Golpe Simples**

```
A criatura can use this Ação Principal to make a Golpe Simples (see Free
Strikes below). Most of the time, you’ll want to use the more impactful
main actions granted by your Classe, kit, or other Recurso, just as the
Diretor will use the main actions in a criatura’s Ficha de Criatura, but free
strikes are available for when all else fails. For instance, a Fúria who has
no other options for À Distância strikes Músculo use the À Distância Arma Free
Golpe Habilidade with an improvised Arma when battling a flying foe.
```

```
Curar
A criatura who uses the Curar Ação Principal employs medicine or
inspiring words to make an Adjacente criatura feel better and stay in
the fight. The alvo criatura can Gastar a Recuperação to regain Vigor,
or can make a Teste de Resistência against um Efeito they are suffering that is
ended by a Teste de Resistência.
```

```
Combate
```

Free Strikes

Every criatura can use a Golpe Simples Habilidade as a Ação Principal on their
Turno, though doing so typically isn’t the most effective choice. Most of
the time, you’ll use free strikes when the rules call for it. Specific rules
let you use free strikes as part of an action that allows you to also do
something else impactful, such as how the Investir Ação Principal lets you
Mover and use a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples in um Ação Principal (see Investir above).

Many rules and abilities allow heroes to make free strikes when it
isn’t their Turno, such as the Tático’s Cobertura Habilidade. As well, all
characters can make an Ataque de Oportunidade Golpe Simples.

**Granted Abilities**

Some abilities, such as the Tático’s Golpe Now or I’ll Receptivo and
You’ll Close abilities, allow another criatura to use a signature Habilidade
or heroic Habilidade when it isn’t their Turno. Unless otherwise stated, a
criatura can always use a Golpe Simples instead of a granted signature
Habilidade or heroic Habilidade.

**Opportunity Attacks**

Whenever a criatura has an inimigo Adjacente to them and the inimigo
willingly moves to a space that isn’t Adjacente to the criatura without
shifting, the criatura can take advantage of that Movimento to quickly
make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against the inimigo as a Reação Livre.
This is called an Ataque de Oportunidade.

If a criatura has a Desvantagem or double Desvantagem on the Poder roll against the
inimigo, they can’t make an Ataque de Oportunidade.

**Standard Free Strikes**

Every Herói has dois standard Golpe Simples abilities available to them. Your
Classe Músculo give you additional Golpe Simples options, and your kit can
improve the standard options (see Chapter 6: Kits).

A Corpo-a-corpo Arma Golpe Simples is a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe made with an unarmed
Golpe or an improvised Arma. A À Distância Arma Golpe Simples is a À Distância
Golpe made with an improvised Arma. At the Diretor’s discretion,
the dano Tipo of an improvised Arma can change based on the
objeto used. For example, if you use a Queimando torch as an improvised
Arma, it could deal Fogo dano when used for a Golpe Simples.

```
Corpo-a-corpo Arma Golpe Simples
Investir, Corpo-a-corpo, Golpe, Arma Ação Principal
e Corpo-a-corpo 1 x um criatura or objeto
```

```

```

```
Opportunity Attacks
The Tático can’t make qualquer opportunity attacks against
these Adjacente Cães de Guerra as they Mover. Despite moving, the
Comando never stops being Adjacente to the Tático, and the
Crucibita shifts away instead of moving.
```

```
Opportunity Attacks: Moving Out
A Cão de Guerra Crucibita moves out of a space that is Adjacente to the
Tático and into a space that isn’t Adjacente. The Tático can
make an Ataque de Oportunidade against the Crucibita.
```

```
Opportunity Attacks: Moving With Banes
The Cão de Guerra eviservite has a Desvantagem on strikes against the
Adjacente Censurador, so the Censurador can freely Mover away from the
evisercite without worrying about the Cão de Guerra making an
Ataque de Oportunidade.
```

Draw Steel

```
Flanqueando
When you and um or more aliados are Adjacente to the same inimigo and
on opposite sides of the inimigo, you are Flanqueando that inimigo. While
Flanqueando an inimigo, you gain an Vantagem on Corpo-a-corpo strikes against them.
```

```
If you’re unsure whether your Herói and an aliado are Flanqueando a foe,
imagine a Linha extending from the center of your space to the center of
your aliado’s space. If that Linha passes through opposite sides or corners of
the inimigo’s space, then you and your aliado are Flanqueando the inimigo.
You must have Linha of Efeito to the inimigo and be able to take triggered
actions to gain or grant the Flanqueando Benefício.
```

```
Flanqueando
The tacitician flanks the Cão de Guerra Amalgamita with the
Elementalista and Talento, since they are on directly opposite
sides of their inimigo. No heroes flank the other Amalgamita.
The Censurador, using an Habilidade with a Distância of Corpo-a-corpo 2, isn’t
Adjacente to the Amalgamita and so can’t flank with the Sombra.
The Fúria and Nulo aren’t on directly opposite sides of the
Amalgamita, and so they aren’t Flanqueando their inimigo either.
```

```
Flanqueando
The Censurador flanks the Cão de Guerra Comando with the Fúria,
since they are on directly opposite sides of their inimigo. The
Trovador isn’t Flanqueando the criatura with the Censurador though,
since they aren’t on directly opposite sides. The Sombra can’t
flank the Crucibita with the Conduíta because the Conduíta is
Atordoado, which prevents them from taking triggered actions.
```

```
Cobertura
The Cão de Guerra Comando has Cobertura against a Golpe from the
tacitician, since a low Parede between them covers half of the
Comando’s body. The tacitician can’t attack the Crucibita,
since much higher walls completely block the Crucibita’s body,
and therefore the tacitician does not have Linha of Efeito to the
Crucibita.
```

Cobertura

```
When you have Linha of Efeito to a criatura or objeto but that alvo has
at least half their form blocked by a solid objeto such as a tree, Parede, or
overturned table, the alvo has Cobertura. You take a Desvantagem on dano-deal-
ing abilities used against criaturas or objetos that have Cobertura from you.
```

Encobrimento

```
Darkness, Névoa, invisibility Magia, and qualquer other Efeito that fully obscures
a criatura or objeto but doesn’t protect their physical form grants that
criatura or objeto Encobrimento. Even if you have Linha of Efeito to such
a alvo, a criatura or objeto has Encobrimento from you if you can’t see
or otherwise observe them. You can alvo a criatura or objeto with
Encobrimento using a Golpe, provided they aren’t Escondida (see Esconder-se
and Furtivo in Chapter 9: Tests). However, strikes against such alvos
take a Desvantagem.
```

**Invisível criaturas**

```
Invisível criaturas always have Encobrimento from other criaturas. If an
Invisível criatura isn’t Escondida, they can still be targeted by abilities. The
Teste made to find a Escondida criatura who is Invisível takes a Desvantagem.
```

```
Encobrimento
The Tático is shrouded in Névoa, which provides them with
Encobrimento against a Golpe from the Cão de Guerra Crucibita. The
Crucibita’s Golpe takes a Desvantagem as a result.
```

```
Combate
```

```
Vigor
Your Herói’s survivability is represented by your Vigor. Think of
Vigor as a combination of a criatura’s physical vitality and their
overall energy for dodging and resisting incoming blows, spells, and
other violence. It’s not that every instance of dano deals a Sangrando
wound to you, but that each um chips away at your Habilidade to fight
effectively. um attack Músculo make you sweat as you Pulo back to
avoid an arrow, while another Músculo graze your elbow with a dagger
nick, leaving a dull, distracting pain. Eventually, this Drenante of energy
leaves you Receptivo for bigger blows that can truly harm your body—or
possibly kill you.
```

```
After qualquer dano you take is reduced by Imunidade a Dano or other
effects, your Vigor is reduced by an amount equal to the remaining
dano. Some effects can also reduce your Vigor maximum, limiting
the amount of Vigor you can regain.
```

```
Recoveries and Recuperação Value
Each Herói has a number of Recoveries determined by their Classe. A
Herói also has a Recuperação value that equals um-third of their Vigor
maximum, rounded down. When you use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra
durante o Combate (see Maneuvers above), you Gastar a Recuperação and regain
Vigor equal to your Recuperação value. fora de Combate, you can
Gastar as many Recoveries as you have remaining. Some abilities, items,
and other effects allow you to Gastar a Recuperação to regain Vigor
equal to your Recuperação value plus a little extra (as described by the
Efeito), or to regain Vigor without spending a Recuperação.
```

dano

Strikes, Área attacks, environmental effects, and other hazards can all
deal dano to the heroes and their foes. Whenever a criatura takes
dano, they reduce their Vigor (see below) by an amount equal to
the dano taken.

**dano Types**

Typical dano, such as that caused by weapons, Caindo, traps, and
monstrous Garras, has no Tipo associated with it. That’s because for
most criaturas, there’s no difference in the amount of harm caused by
being run through with a pike, dropped from a height onto a Pedra floor,
slashed by a pendulum scythe, or skewered on a Minotauro’s horns.

However, when it comes to Elemental and Sobrenatural dano
sources, some criaturas Músculo have an immunity or weakness to that
dano. As such, abilities and effects note when they deal qualquer of the
following dano types: Ácido, Frio, Corrupção, Fogo, Sagrado, Elétrico,
Veneno, Psíquico, or Sônico.

Imunidade a Dano
Imunidade a Dano means that a criatura can ignore some or all of the
dano they would usually take from certain attacks or effects.

Imunidade a Dano Músculo have a dano Tipo associated with it,
expressed as “[dano Tipo] immunity.” Imunidade a Dano often has a
value associated with it, so that um criatura’s Ficha de Criatura notes “dano
immunity 5” (representing immunity to all dano), while another
criatura has “Elétrico immunity 5.” Whenever a alvo with dano
immunity takes dano of the indicated Tipo, they can reduce the
dano by the value of the immunity (to a minimum of 0 dano). If
the value of the immunity is “all,” then the alvo ignores all dano of
the indicated Tipo.

Imunidade a Dano should be the last thing applied when calculating
dano. For instance, if your Herói has Fogo immunity 5 and takes 8 Fogo
dano, they take 3 dano. But if an aliado first halved the dano with
a Reação, your Herói would take 4 dano before immunity is
applied, with immunity then reducing the dano to 0.

If multiple dano immunities apply to a source of dano, only the
immunity with the highest value applies. For instance, a criatura with
Imunidade a Dano 5 and Fogo immunity 10 who takes 12 Fogo dano
reduces the dano by 10 points.

Fraqueza a Dano
Fraqueza a Dano works like Imunidade a Dano, except that criaturas
take extra dano whenever they take dano of the indicated
Tipo. For instance, if a criatura has Fogo weakness 5 and is dealt 10 Fogo
dano, they take 15 Fogo dano instead.

A criatura who has “Fraqueza a Dano X” with no specific Tipo or
Palavra-Chave indicated has weakness of the indicated amount when they
take dano of qualquer Tipo.

If a criatura has both Imunidade a Dano and Fraqueza a Dano for a
source of dano, apply the weakness first, then the immunity.

If multiple dano weaknesses apply to a source of dano, only the
weakness with the highest value applies.

Draw Steel

```
Ofegante
Your Ofegante value equals half your Vigor maximum. When your
Vigor is equal to or less than your Ofegante value, you are Ofegante.
Although being Ofegante has no effects on its own, certain Linhagem,
Classe, item, Título, and Monstro abilities affect Ofegante criaturas.
```

```
You can tell when other criaturas are Ofegante and vice versa.
```

```
Morrendo and Morte
When your Vigor is 0 or lower, you are Morrendo. While Morrendo, you
can’t use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra durante o Combate. Additionally, you are
Sangrando, and this instance of the Condição can’t be negated or removed
in qualquer way until you are no longer Morrendo. While you are Morrendo, you can
still act, your aliados can help you Gastar Recoveries durante o Combate, and you
can Gastar Recoveries out of Combate as usual.
```

```
While your Vigor is lower than 0, if it reaches the negative of your
Ofegante value, you die. When you die, you can’t be brought back to
Vida without the use of a Especial powerful item, such as a Scroll of
Resurrection.
```

```
Diretor-Controlled criaturas
In most circumstances, Diretor-controlled criaturas die or are
destroyed when their Vigor drops to 0.
```

```
No Recoveries
Diretor-controlled criaturas don’t have Recoveries or a Recuperação value.
qualquer such criaturas who regain Vigor during a battle do so by way of
a Especial item or an Habilidade in their Ficha de Criatura. However, there are times
when a Herói Músculo wish to use an Habilidade that allows another criatura
to Gastar a Recuperação or to regain Vigor equal to their Recuperação value
on an injured NPC. In such cases, a Diretor-controlled criatura regains
Vigor equal to um-third of their Vigor maximum.
```

**Knocking criaturas Out**

```
If you dano a criatura with an Habilidade that would kill them, you can
choose to instead knock them Inconsciente. If a criatura takes dano
while Inconsciente in this way, they die.
Diretor-controlled criaturas remain Inconsciente for 1 hour if no um
does anything to wake them. They then gain 1 Vigor and are no
longer Inconsciente.
```

```
Heroes remain Inconsciente for 1 hour if no um does anything to
wake them. After 1 hour, they can Gastar a Recuperação and are no longer
Inconsciente. If the Herói has no Recoveries left, they can’t wake up until
they finish a Descanso.
```

```
Inconsciente
While you are Inconsciente, you can’t take main actions, maneuvers,
triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers; your
Velocidade is 0; you are unaware of your surroundings; and you are Derrubado.
Habilidade rolls against you have a double Vantagem. If you wake up from being
Inconsciente, you can Levantar from Derrubado as a Manobra Livre.
```

```
Temporary Vigor
Some abilities, treasures, and other effects grant a criatura temporary
Vigor. Temporary Vigor shouldn’t be included in a criatura’s
Vigor total when figuring out a criatura’s Recuperação value or Ofegante
value. If you have temporary Vigor while Ofegante, Morrendo, or dead, the
temporary Vigor doesn’t change those states.
```

```
Whenever you take dano while you have temporary Vigor, the
temporary Vigor decreases first, and qualquer leftover dano is applied
to your Vigor as usual. For instance, if you have 10 temporary
Vigor and take 16 dano, you lose the temporary Vigor and then
lose another 6 Vigor.
There is no maximum to how much temporary Vigor you can
have. Regaining Vigor can’t restore temporary Vigor. If you have
temporary Vigor and then gain more temporary Vigor, you
get whichever amount of temporary Vigor is greater, rather than
adding the dois pools together. For instance, if an Habilidade grants you 10
temporary Vigor when you already have 5, you have 10 temporary
Vigor, not 15.
```

```
Unless otherwise indicated, temporary Vigor disappears at the end
of an Encontro.
```

```
objeto Vigor
Mundano objetos in the game have Vigor based on the material
they’re made of. When an objeto’s Vigor is reduced to 0, the objeto
is destroyed. objetos have Veneno immunity all and Psíquico immunity
all, though the Diretor can remove um or both of these immunities in
the case of living objetos, such as plants. A Tamanho 1 objeto or 1 Quadrado of a
larger objeto made of common materials has Vigor as follows:
```

```
¥ Glass: 1 Vigor
¥ Wood: 3 Vigor
¥ Pedra: 6 Vigor
¥ Metal: 9 Vigor
The Diretor can decide that a well-made or poorly made objeto has
more or less Vigor. Destroying a Sobrenatural objeto often (but not
always) requires a specific quest, such as throwing a Magia ring back
into the volcano where it was forged.
```

Underwater Combate

```
If a criatura is fully submerged in Água, they have Fogo immunity 5 and
Elétrico weakness 5. If they can’t automatically Nadar at full Velocidade
while moving, their Poder rolls take a Desvantagem.
```

```
Sufocando
During Combate or under similarly stressful circumstances, you can hold
your Sopro for a number of Combate rounds equal to your Músculo score
(minimum 1 Ronda). At the end of each Combate Ronda after that, you
take 1d6 dano while holding your Sopro.
```

```
Out of Combate, you can hold your Sopro for a number of minutes equal
to your Músculo score. Being unable to breathe after that time counts as a
stressful Condição, causing you to run out of Ar as above.
```

```
Combate
```

Mounted Combate

A willing criatura with the Montaria role (see criatura Roles in
_Draw Steel: Monsters_ ) can serve as your Montaria as long as their Tamanho
is greater than yours. You can Escalar onto your Montaria freely (see
Escalador Other criaturas above). You determine which space you
occupy. While mounted, you can take the Montar Ação de Movimento, but a
Montaria can only be ridden this way once per Ronda. Both Montaria and
rider each take a Turno during Combate.

If a criatura riding a Montaria is force moved, they are knocked off
the Montaria and must Fazer um Teste to determine how they land (see
Escalador Other criaturas). If a Montaria is force moved, they carry qualquer
riders with them. Riders and mounts Teleportar-se separately.

If your Montaria dies, they fall Derrubado, and you fall off them and land Derrubado
in the nearest quadrado desocupado of your choice.

End of Combate

At the end of Combate, the Diretor determines if the heroes earn qualquer
Victories. qualquer Efeito or Condição on you that you suffered during
Combate (except for being Ofegante, Inconsciente, or Morrendo) ends if
you want it to.

**How Combate Ends**

The Diretor determines when a Combate Encontro is over. While some
battles—especially showdowns with important villains—can be about
a fight to the bitter end, many other encounters can become a tedious
slog if the heroes need to fight until every last inimigo’s Vigor is
reduced to 0.

To avoid a battle dragging, the Diretor can set objectives when they
build the Encontro. Once the heroes achieve those objectives, or if
it becomes Tempo Limpo that they can win the fight with minimal effort, the
Diretor can end the Encontro. They Músculo do so by calling “Cut!” like
a film Diretor, or they can use some other phrase or indicator.

When the Diretor ends Combate this way, the jogadores typically choose
how the battle ends by narrating a dramatic finish. Or in rarer cases
when the heroes achieve a major Objetivo that sets off a story-defin-
ing event, the Diretor narrates the end of the battle with a positive
outcome for the jogadores, called an event ending (see below).

**Objetivo Endings**

While planning a Combate Encontro, the Diretor can set um or more
objectives the heroes can achieve to end the Encontro without
dropping every last foe. Some broad categories of objectives are
described in this section, but the Diretor should feel free to create their
own. As well, Directors can always end Combate anytime it becomes
Tempo Limpo that the heroes are going to win an Encontro with minimal effort,
even if they haven’t achieved all the objectives.

Each of the Objetivo endings in this section is explored in detail—
including looking at Monstro roles, map advice, Sucesso conditions, and
more—in the Introduction section of _Draw Steel: Monsters_.

Diminish Numbers
The simplest Combate Encontro Objetivo is almost always “defeat them
before they defeat us.” Though the heroes don’t have to kill every last
inimigo in this Tipo of Encontro, winning the day requires that they Empurrar
their opponents to the point where they are broken, flee, or surrender.

```
Defeat a Specific Foe
An Encontro built around defeating a specific foe includes um or
more of the heroes’ inimigos commanding the rest, such as a hobgoblin
Lorde de Sangue Conduzindo a group of mercenaries, or um or more particularly
powerful foes among a group of weaker ones, such as a pair of tusker
demons in a Gnoll Guerra band. Because these more-powerful inimigos are
the stars of the Encontro, if only Fraca foes are left once the stars are
gone, the battle loses its Desafio and it’s time to wrap it up. It makes
sense for those weaker foes to flee or surrender once their strongest
aliados have gone down.
```

```
Get the Thing!
Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objetos that the heroes must
protect from the forces of evil: Magia rings, royal birth certificates,
Dragão eggs, and the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds
with their inimigos as they race to collect a valuable or important item
from a guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the item
from a group of inimigos already in possession of it.
Objectives in this category work well when paired with other
objectives, such as defeating a specific foe. For instance, the heroes must
steal a ledger containing a record of Criminoso activity from an Supermente
and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain the ledger, the battle
won’t be over until they also defeat the Supermente, who won’t let the
book go without a fight!
```

Draw Steel

```
Destroy the Thing!
Combate doesn’t always have to be about destroying your inimigos.
Sometimes it’s about destroying their stuff! Queimando a Pirata Capitão’s
vessel, closing a portal to the Abissal Wasteland before it lets in an
army of demons, or shutting down a massive kobold Armadilha made of
Lâminas Giratórias could so hamper the heroes’ foes that the battle is no
longer worth fighting once the dano is done.
```

```
Save Another
No um earns the mantle of Herói without saving a few lives. Sometimes
the point of an Encontro isn’t to kill, but to save as many folks as you
can. If the heroes rescue powerful aliados from the clutches of their foes
during Combate, the added strength of those aliados Músculo be enough
to make the remainder of the Encontro trivial. When you and your
companions save a Grifo from a crew of poachers, the hunters become
the ... well, you know the rest.
```

```
Escort
Surprising as it may seem, sometimes the Destino of the mission doesn’t
rest on the heroes’ shoulders at all! Sometimes it rests on the shoulders
of someone standing next to the heroes. The heroes’ job is to keep this
important person safe as they travel to a specific destination.
Not every escort Encontro is on behalf of a wise or mighty aliado.
Sometimes the heroes are tasked with protecting a helpless or even an
actively troublesome criatura, such as a hapless Nobre or a wayward
child. They Músculo even have to protect a bulky or inconvenient
inanimate objeto. Whatever the case, the inimigos just keep coming
until the heroes get their Investir to their destination.
```

```
Hold Them Off
Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They Músculo need to
battle a conquering tyrant’s army to allow innocent villagers time to
escape. They Músculo need to hold off Ondulante after Ondulante of zombies while
a group of priests completes a ritual to lay the Morto-Vivo to rest for good.
To achieve this Objetivo, the heroes need to stay alive and protect a
particular position for a number of rounds determined by you.
```

```
Assault the Defenses
The inimigo holds a strategically important position and the heroes
want it. The Encontro ends when the heroes secure the Objetivo
defensive location for themselves, even if there are more inimigos
outside it. Sometimes an Encontro with this Objetivo is part of a
combined Objetivo, as when heroes must first assault the defenses,
then hold that defensive position against counterattack.
```

```
Stop the Action
Sometimes Combate is complicated by the fact that the heroes need to
stop the villainous actions of their foes. It’s not enough to simply defeat
the warriors in a cult. The heroes must also stop the zealots’ archdev-
il-summoning ritual! Or it Músculo be that the heroes need to interrupt
a wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn’t marry the heir to the
throne. Despite Combate, the mage forces the ceremony to continue!
Objectives in this category have a timer associated with them. If the
heroes don’t achieve the Objetivo in a certain number of rounds, the
conditions of the battle could well change. For instance, if the cultists
summon the archdevil, defeating the Diabo suddenly becomes the
heroes’ new Objetivo!
```

```
Complete the Action
This Encontro Objetivo sees the characters charged with initiating
an event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the heroes
are attempting to launch an airship while repelling a Invasor do Futuro
boarding party, the Encontro could be over the moment the heroes
manage to Ativar the vessel and take off with just a few time raiders
actually aboard.
```

```
Dramatic Finish
If the heroes are able to end a fight with a dramatic finish, the Diretor
assigns each Herói um or more of their remaining inimigos, then asks
that Herói’s jogador to describe how the Herói neutralizes that threat. The
Herói Músculo deliver a killing blow, knock their foe out, or let the inimigo
flee with their tail between their legs (literally or figuratively). If the
fight has more heroes than Diretor-controlled inimigos, the Diretor
can assign more than um Herói to an inimigo, then ask the jogadores
how their characters work together to bring that inimigo down. After
everyone gives a description, the battle ends.
```

**Event Ending**

```
If the Diretor calls the end of Combate when a specific Objetivo in
an Encontro is achieved, the event ending creates a big narrative
finish. The Diretor can pick a narrative Gatilho for an event ending
before an Encontro begins, or can come up with um on the Voar if that
makes more sense.
Event endings can Cobertura big scenarios such as the characters destroying
a dam to unleash a river upon their inimigos, or completing a ritual
that causes all the demons they’ve been battling to be sent back to the
Abissal Wasteland, accompanied by visual details. For example, if the
heroes are battling a necromancer who controls a Horda of zombies, the
Morto-Vivo Músculo all crumble to dust when the necromancer is defeated. If
the heroes destroy an eldritch machine sapping the land of its natural
energy, the Onda de Choque from the device’s destruction could vaporize the
cultists attempting to protect it.
```

```
Fleeing Foes
If you’ve played a fantasy RPG before, odds are you’ve had an
Encontro where you didn’t chase down every last fleeing
foe—and then um such foe Agarrado another bunch of evil
buddies and came back to ambush you. It takes only um
experience like this to create jogadores who promise, “No
survivors. No mercy!” whenever foes break ranks. Chasing
down every last foe can be fun once in a while, but it can easily
Turno a tactical Encontro into a slog.
Luckily, this is a heroic game. Although the Diretor can
surprise the jogadores with dramatic reveals and twisty-turny
stories, “Gotcha!” moments that make jogadores Desconfiado of
every fleeing bandit shouldn’t be part of those stories. If a
bandit is fleeing an Encontro, they’re running away to rethink
their Vida. If they’re going for help, the jogadores should get some
sense of that—for example, the bandit screaming at the top
of their lungs for help as they run toward their Líder’s tent.
That way, the jogadores can process what’s happening, and will
understand that stopping that fleeing bandit is part of the
Desafio of the Encontro.
```

Negociação
```

```
Chapter 11
```

# **Negociação**

Negociar dá aos heróis uma chance de conseguir o que querem sem combate... ou ao menos sem mais combate! Você pode negociar com um rei para obter apoio militar contra uma invasão demoníaca em um reino vizinho. Você pode tentar convencer uma líder de bandidos a parar de atacar caravanas de mercadores na estrada e, em vez disso, mirar em nobres leais a um tirano. Você pode tentar convencer um arquimago a permitir acesso à sua biblioteca secreta para pesquisar a localização de um machado matador-de-dragões. A Negociação cobre todos esses cenário e mais.

Pense na Negociação como aprender um novo sistema de combate, exploração ou investigação em um RPG. Este conjunto de regras oferece uma estrutura para interpretação. As regras de Negociação devem ser lidas tanto por jogadores quanto por Diretores, para que todos entendam as regras de Negociação. Se você nunca jogou um jogo com um sistema de Negociação dedicado como esse, você pode precisar passar por ele uma ou duas vezes antes de dominá-lo, assim como para aprender qualquer subconjunto de regras de um RPG. Se um jogador não tiver lido essas regras, o Diretor e os demais podem explicá-las durante sua primeira Negociação.

Negociação é uma estrutura para interpretar encontros importantes onde os heróis querem convencer um NPC a tomar certas ações, como emprestar um Artefato aos heróis ou perdoar um prisioneiro. Esta estrutura monitora o Interesse do NPC nos argumentos do herói e sua Paciência, para que o Diretor saiba o que o NPC está disposto a oferecer e quando é hora de encerrar a cena. Esta estrutura não deve substituir a interpretação (embora certamente possa ajudar se seu grupo não gosta dessa parte em RPGs). A estrutura está aqui para ajudar jogadores e Diretores a entenderem os mecanismos do vai e vem de uma conversa, além de dar algumas regras que podem tornar uma conversa de alto risco ainda mais dramática!

## Quando Negociar

Para que uma Negociação ocorra, um NPC precisa ter interesse em negociar com os heróis - mas também razões para não simplesmente aceitar o que eles propõem. Negociações só ocorrem quando o NPC tem essa tensão interna entre interesse e relutância. Por exemplo, se os personagens pedem ao rei que envie seu exército para lutar contra uma invasão demoníaca num reino vizinho, o rei precisa estar dividido. Ele quer deter a invasão, mas também não quer arriscar a vida de seus soldados defendendo um reino estrangeiro, deixando os seus próprios súditos desprotegidos. Se os heróis quiserem a ajuda desse exército, eles terão que negociar.

Não se espera que os heróis usem essas regras toda vez que tentarem convencer um NPC. Por exemplo, se um herói quer que um cultista capturado dê informações sobre o líder do culto, um Teste de Presença usando Mentir ou um Teste de Músculo com Intimidar provavelmente bastam. Um personagem que quiser flertar com o alquimista local para conseguir uma Poção de Cura grátis provavelmente só precisa de um Teste de Presença com a Perícia Flertar resolve.

Por outro lado, Negociações normalmente envolvem todos os heróis interagindo com um ou mais NPCs importantes que podem oferecer informações, itens ou serviços capazes de mudar o rumo da aventura.  
Geralmente, isso envolve buscar um item de grande poder, um militante ou companheiro, os serviços de uma organização ou nação influente ou uma informação que cause uma reviravolta na trama. Convencer um Lich a emprestar o lendário _Codex Mortis_, persuadir um dragão a parar de atacar a torre de um mago ou convencer os generais de um exército inimigo a recuar significa que é hora de uma negociação.

Para negociar com sucesso, os heróis precisam apresentar argumentos persuasivos para convencer os NPCs. "Faça isso ou matamos você" é uma ameaça que pode acompanhar um Teste de Músculo com a Perícia Intimidar, mas não é uma tática de negociação.

### Limites da Negociação

Alguns jogadores podem achar que o sistema de Negociação deveria funcionar como uma espécie de controle mental. Eles não estão acostumados a ver NPCs como personagens complexos e podem tentar negociar em situações onde isso não faz sentido ou é literalmente impossível. Não importa quão eloquente um herói seja, nenhum argumento vai convencer o vil Lorde Syuul a abandonar o mal e virar jardineiro. Uma negociação tipicamente não pode convencer uma rainha a entregar sua coroa aos heróis e nomeá-los os novos governantes ou inspirar um dragão a entregar todo o seu tesouro. Negociações só funcionam quando os heróis pedem algo que o NPC está disposto a seriamente considerar dar a eles.

Negociação não é um processo que muda a personalidade de um NPC. Os heróis estão tentando fazer com que ele perceba que agir diferente ainda está dentro de seu caráter. Você pode ser capaz de fazer o até então leal tenente de um chefe maligno reconsiderar seus erros. É um clichê dramático clássico. Ainda assim, você não está mudando a personalidade dele - você está convencendo ele de que suas ações cruéis lhe cabem. "É isso quem você é? É assim que você quer ser lembrado?!"

Se alguns jogadores querem usar a Negociação como desculpa para que seus personagens digam "Faça o que mandamos, senão!", você pode lembrá-los de que não é assim que a maioria das pessoas, incluindo NPCs, funciona. Qualquer herói que comece com essa atitude provavelmente perderá a negociação antes mesmo que ela comece.

### A Ameaça de Violência

No mundo real, negociações raramente ocorrem com a ameaça de violência imediata. Embaixadores não costumam ir para as vias de fato. Mas este é um RPG de fantasia heroica, com heróis armados até os dentes e capazes de alterar a realidade com o poder da mente. A ameaça de violência já está implícita. Todos envolvidos sabem que os personagens podem sacar armas a qualquer momento.

O Diretor tipicamente assume que o potencial implícito para que a situação se torne violenta já está sendo considerado em qualquer Negociação. Entretanto, se os heróis quiserem tornar essa ameaça mais evidente, então eles saem do espaço da Negociação e entram em um tipo diferente de relacionamento - e provavelmente é hora de sacar armas.

Negociação é sobre persuadir alguém a ajudar você voluntariamente porque você convenceu ele de que alcançar seus objetivos é uma boa ideia. Colaborar com você é sábio ou óbvio ou pode fazê-lo parecer bem para outros. Um herói pode absolutamente ameaçar alguém com violência e forçá-lo a fazer o que quiser, mas estes é um estado incrivelmente temporário. Um NPC ameaçado não está fazendo o que foi pedido por vontade própria. Ele o está fazendo sobe ameaça de violência e irá agir de acordo apenas enquanto esta ameaça for evidente - depois disso, ele provavelmente voltará ao comportamento anterior assim que pensar que puder fazer isso.

## Atributos de Negociação

Durante a Negociação, o Diretor designa aos NPCs quatro atributos e recursos temporários - Interesse, Paciência, Motivações e Implicâncias. Os heróis pode conseguir um acordo favorável se maximizarem o Interesse de um NPC ao apresentarem argumentos que apelam a suas Motivações e evitam suas Implicâncias - mas precisam fazer tudo isso antes que a Paciência do NPC acabe.

### Interesse

O Interesse de um NPC representa o quão disposto ele está a fazer um acordo com os heróis. O Interesse é medido em uma escala de 0 (sem Interesse) a 5 (Interesse máximo). Quando uma Negociação começa, o Interesse de um NPC está entre 1 e 4. Se o Interesse do NPC chegar a 5, ele faz uma oferta final e a Negociação termina (veja Continuar ou Parar, abaixo). Se o Interesse cair para 0, ele encerra a Negociação sem oferecer nada aos heróis.

O Interesse aumenta ou diminui durante a Negociação, dependendo dos argumentos feitos pelos heróis.

### Paciência

A Paciência de um NPC representa quanto tempo e esforço ele está disposto a dedicar à Negociação. A Paciência é medida em uma escala de 0 a 5, com cada NPC começando a Negociação com Paciência maior que 0. Se a Paciência de um NPC chegar a 0, ele faz uma oferta final e a Negociação termina (veja Continuar ou Parar).

A Paciência pode diminuir a cada argumento feito pelos heróis durante a Negociação.

#### Idioma e Paciência

Se um ou mais heróis envolvidos na Negociação falarem o Idioma nativo do NPC (excluindo Caeliano), a Paciência do NPC aumenta em 1 no início da Negociação (até o máximo de 5). Se três ou mais heróis falam o Idioma nativo do NPC, a Paciência aumenta em 2 (até o máximo de 5). Capítulo 4: Antecedentes tem mais informações sobre alguns dos Idiomas do jogo.

### Motivações

Cada NPC possui pelo menos duas Motivações às quais os heróis podem apelar em seus argumentos. Argumentos que apelam a uma Motivação do NPC fazem um Lançamento de Poder mais fácil para aumentar o Interesse do NPC. Argumentos que não apelam a uma Motivação fazem um Lançamento de Poder mais difícil. Veja Fazendo Argumentos para mais informações.

Cada Motivação só pode ser utilizada com sucesso uma vez por Negociação. Para apelar com sucesso a uma Motivação, os heróis devem usá-la em um argumento sem mencionar uma Implicância do NPC ou serem pegos mentindo.

### Implicâncias

Implicâncias são Motivações que causam raiva, desconforto, vergonha, medo ou outras respostas negativas em um NPC. Usar uma Implicância em um argumento reduz o Interesse e a Paciência do NPC. Cada NPC tem pelo menos uma Implicância e muitos têm duas ou mais.

Implicâncias e Motivações são dois lados da mesma moeda. Elas são apresentadas abaixo como uma lista única, pois o que pode ser uma Motivação para um NPC pode ser uma Implicância para outro. Sempre que os heróis fazem um argumento, correm o risco de esbarrar em uma Implicância, a menos que tenham feito uma boa pesquisa ou saibam entender bem o NPC.

### Lista de Motivações e Implicâncias

Um NPC pode ter qualquer uma das doze Motivações ou Implicâncias a seguir.

#### Benevolência

Um NPC com Motivação de Benevolência acredita em compartilhar o que tem com os outros. No entanto, um NPC envolvido em uma Negociação precisa ter limites em sua Benevolência, para que não simplesmente dê aos heróis o que eles querem.

Às vezes a Benevolência de um NPC pode se estender apenas a um grupo específico de pessoas, como um capitão pirata benevolente que divide seu saque livremente com a tripulação - mas ainda assim está saqueando! Outras vezes, a caridade de um NPC pode ser limitada pelo fato de que ele não tem muito a oferecer. Um NPC benevolente pode hesitar em ajudar os heróis porque acredita que seus recursos limitados fariam mais diferença em outro lugar.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Benevolência tem uma visão cínica do mundo, acreditando que nenhuma criatura tem direito a nada apenas por estar viva. A ideia de ajudar os outros por ser a coisa certa a se fazer é absurda, imatura ou ingênua, algo a ser ridicularizado ou suprimido.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Benevolência defendem que, se o NPC fizer um acordo com os heróis, as pessoas de quem o NPC gosta sairão beneficiadas. Exemplos de argumentos incluem:

- “Se você nos emprestar a Espada de Agathor, podemos tornar Capital mais segura para sua guilda ao usá-la para derrotar seus inimigos.”
- “Se você nos teletransportar para a caverna do dragão, daremos metade do tesouro do monstro depois que cortarmos sua cabeça. Isso pode beneficiar gerações de alunos da sua academia!”

#### Descoberta

Um NPC com Motivação de Descoberta deseja aprender novos conhecimentos, explorar locais esquecidos, fazer descobertas por meio de experimentos ou encontrar artefatos perdidos ao tempo. Sua curiosidade e busca por conhecimento podem estar ligadas a um objetivo específico, como buscar a cura para uma doença rara ou encontrar um portal para um mundo distante. Ou pode ser que ele seja simplesmente uma pessoa naturalmente curiosa que quer entender tudo o que puder sobre a Timescape.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Descoberta não tem interesse em encontrar novos lugares, povos ou ideias. Pode ser que o desconhecido o assuste ou o deixe tão desconfortável que prefira permanecer ignorante. Outra opção é que uma busca anterior por descobertas pode ter acabado mal para ele.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Descoberta sustentam que fazer um acordo com os heróis permitirá ao NPC adquirir novos conhecimentos ou obter algo único. Exemplos incluem:

- “Permita que usemos seu cifrador para traduzir a única cópia do _Codex Mortis_ e depois deixaremos você ler o livro.”
- “Sabemos que a viagem até a Ilha Decant é perigosa, mas estamos indo para território inexplorado. Pensamos que sua tripulação de marinheiros gostaria de estar entre os poucos mortais a contemplar esse lugar.”

#### Liberdade

Um NPC com Motivação de Liberdade não quer autoridade acima de si e não deseja exercê-la sobre os outros. Pode ser que ele já possua liberdade pessoal e deseje manter esse status ou que deseje libertar a si mesmo e outros do domínio de terceiros.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Liberdade acredita que um mundo sem autoridade é um mundo em caos e desordem. Ele pode até acreditar que ele mesmo é a pessoa certa para governar e que seus ideais devem se tornar lei.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Liberdade sustentam que ajudar os heróis preservará ou concederá liberdade ao NPC ou a outras pessoas. Exemplos incluem:

- “Eu sei que você quer ver a autoridade da rainha revogada para sempre. Ela não tem herdeiros. Dê-nos a chave do escritório dela para que possamos provar sua corrupção e dar a você a chance de derrubar a monarquia.”
- “Se você prometer nos dar dez frascos de Beijo do Assassino, garantiremos que a prisão do barão seja esvaziada.”

#### Ganância

Um NPC com Motivação de Ganância deseja riqueza e recursos acima de quase tudo. Às vezes esses NPCs são avarentos, como dragões que acumulam moedas e joias, mas nunca as gastam ou doam. Outros ostentam sua riqueza, tratando-a como um sinal de seu status social.

NPCs gananciosos podem dividir sua riqueza com um grupo restrito de pessoas queridas, como um nobre que satisfaz todos os desejos dos filhos. Alguns NPCs podem desejar recursos diferentes de dinheiro, como um demônio que coleciona e devora almas ou um senhor troll que tem fome insaciável pela carne alheia.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Ganância não tem interesse em acumular riquezas ou recursos e se ofende se alguém tentar comprar sua cooperação. Ele valoriza seus ideais acima de desejos materiais.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Ganância sugerem que ajudar os heróis aumentará a riqueza ou os bens do NPC. Exemplos incluem:

- “Você deveria nos ajudar a combater o Supermente. A riqueza de Xorranox é lendária e faremos com que você receba sua parte justa.”
- “Nos dê uma semana para pesquisar sua coleção privada de livros e em troca daremos mais dez tomos únicos que encontramos em um antigo santuário de elfo estelar.”

#### Autoridade Superior

Um NPC com Motivação de Autoridade Superior é firmemente leal a uma pessoa ou força que considera mais importante do que ele próprio. Essa autoridade superior pode ser uma organização, uma divindade ou ser poderoso, um líder formal como um nobre ou monarca, uma presença mística ou força que o NPC não compreende totalmente, ou até alguém que o NPC considera uma figura de autoridade informal (como um irmão mais velho, um herói pessoal, etc.).

Um NPC com a Implicância de Autoridade Superior despreza a ideia de servir a outro. O NPC pode não acreditar que todos devem ser livres, mas certamente acredita que ele próprio não deve responder a ninguém.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Autoridade Superior afirmam que é do interesse dessa autoridade que o NPC faça um acordo com os heróis. Um herói pode até dizer que, se a autoridade estivesse na posição do NPC, ela faria o mesmo. Exemplos incluem:

- “Todas as grandes criações honram seu deus, Malus. Se você me ensinar a forjar o Martelo de Azdul, será uma grande honra para seu deus.”
- “Sabe o que Jarith, o Ousado, faria? Ele nos guiaria pelo imenso deserto até a torre. Você será nosso Jarith?”

#### Justiça

Um NPC com Motivação de Justiça quer ver os justos recompensados e os perversos punidos, por mais subjetiva que seja sua noção de bem e mal. Um sacerdote devoto de um deus da natureza pode acreditar que todos que protegem plantas e animais são justos, enquanto aqueles que exploram recursos naturais, como mineradores e lenhadores, devem morrer. Ter uma Motivação de Justiça não significa que o NPC seja bondoso ou caridoso.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Justiça não acredita que a Timescape seja um lugar inerentemente justo e não tem interesse em torná-lo isto. Para ele, o mundo é feito de conflito eterno, justiça não existe e quem acredita nisso é um tolo ingênuo.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Justiça colocam os heróis ao lado do que o NPC considera correto ou moral. Exemplos incluem:

- "Você despreza aqueles que roubam da natureza. Permita que entremos pacificamente em sua Silva para engarrafarmos a água abençoada da nascente. Vamos usá-la para impedir um exército de derrubar cada árvore e rasgar a terra por onde passa."
- "Você acha que nobres são barões preguiçosos que enriquecem às custas dos camponeses. Queremos destronar Lorde Saxton. Empreste-nos sua equipe de ladrões e garantiremos que, quando Saxton cair, o povo possa escolher seus próprios líderes."

#### Legado

Um NPC com Motivação de Legado deseja fama em vida e reconhecimento que perdure após a morte. Ele espera que outros conheçam e se lembrem de seus feitos, grandiosos ou terríveis. Alguns desses NPCs podem até buscar a imortalidade por meio da divinização ou da não-morte, para que o fim de sua forma mortal não os impeça de continuar fazendo história.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Legado não se importa em deixar uma marca pessoal no mundo. Para ele, esse tipo de vaidade é apenas uma perda de tempo.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Legado sustentam que fazer um acordo com os heróis aumenta as chances de que o povo fale sobre o NPC por séculos. Exemplos incluem:

- "Se você nos der o itinerário do grão-vizir, eu vou compor uma canção sobre sua coragem ao desafiá-lo e então cantá-la em todas as tavernas daqui até Ix!"
- "Sim, perder a batalha é uma possibilidade. Se isso acontecer, os gnolls ainda virão atrás de você eventualmente. Mas se esmagarmos nossos inimigos, imagine as homenagens, as histórias, os poemas, as estátuas — tudo isso criado para você porque suas máquinas de cerco viraram o jogo."

#### Paz

Um NPC com Motivação de Paz quer tranquilidade em sua vida. Em circunstâncias normais, ele deseja ser deixado em paz para cuidar de seus negócios, fazenda, reino, império criminoso ou qualquer pequeno pedaço da Timescape que lhe pertence. Alguns desses NPCs ainda não têm paz e precisam de ajuda para conquistá-la, enquanto outros desejam manter o status atual.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Paz odeia o tédio. Ele deseja emoção, drama e perigo em sua vida. Para ele, não há nada pior do que a mesmice.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Paz afirmam que ajudar os heróis trará alguma tranquilidade ao NPC, ao menos por um tempo. Exemplos incluem:

- "Você está indo bem aqui. Um pouco de roubo de nobres, contrabando de álcool e alguns cassinos ilegais. Ninguém está se machucando, mas o Oficial Cofax está se aproximando. Podemos redirecioná-lo para uma ameaça real à comunidade, se você nos ajudar a armar uma armadilha para o Relojoeiro."
- "Eu sei que você não vende para forasteiros, mas precisamos desse elmo. Vou usá-lo para repelir um grupo de hobgoblins que está vindo para cá. Eles não serão tão amigáveis quanto nós."

#### Poder

Um NPC com Motivação de Poder deseja a autoridade dos outros. Ele quer aumentar sua influência, por maior que ela já possa ser, e manter seu domínio. Pode buscar poder por meio da conquista, da coleta de artefatos ou de rituais sobrenaturais — embora por que escolher só um método quando combinar os três pode trazer os melhores resultados? Alguns desses NPCs são tiranos que cruzam mundos, mas até administradores mesquinhos de vilarejos e santuários podem cobiçar poder com igual intensidade.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Poder não tem interesse em autoridade para si. Ele pode até respeitar a autoridade de outros, mas odeia a ideia de governar sobre alguém e rejeita completamente qualquer sugestão disso.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Poder sustentam que trabalhar com os heróis aumentará ou protegerá o poder do NPC. Exemplos incluem:

- "Todo mundo sabe que você deveria comandar a guarda, Percy. A velha está se aposentando e nosso amigo Barão Kuglar vai escolher o substituto. Agora, se você nos deixar entrar no arsenal restrito, podemos falar bem de você para ele."
- "Sabemos que ele é seu irmão, Alteza, mas ele é o mais velho — o primeiro na linha do trono. Se nos ajudar a provar que ele faz parte de um culto, você se torna o filho favorito."

> **NPCs Mudam com o Tempo**
>
> Assim como os heróis, NPCs em Negociações são indivíduos complexos que podem mudar ao longo do tempo. É possível que os heróis precisem negociar com o mesmo NPC diversas vezes durante a Campanha e, com o passar do tempo, as Motivações e Implicâncias desse NPC podem mudar. Se os heróis transformarem um capitão bandido com Motivações de Ganância e Poder em um aliado temporário, esse criminoso pode aprender com eles, passando a roubar apenas de quem explora os pobres e distribuindo esses ganhos a quem precisa. Na próxima Negociação com esse capitão, suas Motivações podem ser Benevolência e Proteção.

#### Proteção

Um NPC com Motivação de Proteção tem terras, pessoas, informações, objetos ou uma organização que deseja proteger acima de tudo. Manter sua responsabilidade segura é um dever que leva muito a sério e quem ajuda nessa proteção conquista sua confiança. A maioria das pessoas tem amigos ou família que deseja proteger, mas um NPC com a Motivação de Proteção acredita em fazer isso a qualquer custo.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Proteção está feliz em deixar os outros se virarem sozinhos. Ele não acredita que seja sua responsabilidade proteger ninguém além de si mesmo e pode até sentir repulsa pela ideia de arriscar sua vida ou propriedades para proteger os outros.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Proteção afirmam que ajudar os heróis permitirá ao NPC proteger melhor aquilo que é importante para ele. Exemplos incluem:

- "Soldados mortos aumentam o exército da necromante. A aniquilação total é a única forma de derrotá-la. Marche conosco agora, enquanto o exército dela ainda é pequeno, e nós a derrotaremos. Ou você pode arriscar que alguém tente, fracasse e logo ela estará às suas portas com um exército dez vezes maior."
- "Vejo que seu neto está determinado a entrar no serviço militar. Acontece que tenho uma armadura mágica que pode ajudá-lo a resistir aos golpes de monstros e bandidos. Ficarei feliz em lhe dar a armadura, em troca de nos emprestar seus grifos por alguns dias. Afinal, não vou precisar dela se puder simplesmente voar sobre os monstros do pântano."

#### Folia

Um NPC com a Motivação de Folia só quer se divertir. Ele gosta de socializar em festas, buscar adrenalina ou se entregar a outras atividades hedonistas. Obter prazer da vida e passar tempo com pessoas de quem gosta é fundamental para esses NPCs.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Folia vê encontros sociais e hedonismo como perda de tempo. Eles só sentem prazer no trabalho ou no aperfeiçoamento de suas habilidades e caráter. Quem sugere devassidão imatura não merece seu tempo.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Folia afirmam que fazer um acordo com os heróis permitirá ao NPC voltar à diversão mais cedo, por mais tempo ou com mais intensidade. Exemplos incluem:

- "O que você acha de ter as músicas mais exclusivas para sua celebração de aniversário exclusiva na próxima semana? Posso compor uma lista de músicas totalmente originais, de graça... desde que você convide a mim e à minha banda para a festa."
- "Eu sei que você não quer forjar cinco Coroas Cronocinésicas. Que tal o seguinte: você faz isso por mim e eu lhe dou os quatorze barris de uísque que encontramos em uma ruína de Anões de Aço. Essa bebida é antiga, única e forte o bastante para lhe fazer esquecer o próprio nome. Você pode abrir um barril com seus amigos para comemorar o trabalho bem feito."

#### Vingança

Um NPC com a Motivação de Vingança quer ferir alguém que o feriu. Seu desejo de revanche pode ser proporcional ao dano sofrido ou pode querer retribuir com juros. Em alguns casos, o desejo de vingança só se realiza com a morte do inimigo, mas outros NPCs podem querer retribuir sua dor com humilhação, ruína profissional ou outro sofrimento menos permanente.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Vingança acredita que vingança não resolve nada. Ele pode ter aprendido isso na prática ou simplesmente não ter ambição para buscá-la — e tende a desprezar quem busca.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Vingança afirmam que o NPC pode se vingar ajudando os heróis. Exemplos incluem:

- "Os servos de Ajax mataram sua irmã enquanto ela procurava pelos cultos dele na cidade. O Pacto do Ferro Preto serve ao Overlorde. Dê-nos os diários dela e talvez descubramos o esconderijo do pacto para desferir um grande golpe nos seus inimigos."
- "Aquele brincalhão do Huckable rasgou suas calças na última reunião do conselho. Você não quer se vingar? Podemos armar uma pegadinha deliciosa na próxima reunião, mas precisamos que você garanta a segurança dos Orcs refugiados."

## Começando uma Negociação

Uma Negociação começa quando os heróis pedem algo a um NPC e o Diretor decide que as circunstâncias exigem uma Negociação. Essas circunstâncias sempre envolvem os heróis precisando de ajuda que pode mudar o rumo da aventura e o NPC estando em dúvida sobre colaborar. Ao contrário do combate, que pode ser forçado por aliados violentos ou circunstâncias inesperadas, os heróis devem ser aqueles que iniciam uma Negociação voluntariamente. Personagens devem querer algo do NPC. Caso contrário, eles não têm motivo para negociar!

O Diretor pode decidir que um NPC com algo que os jogadores querem pode bater à porta e perguntar se os heróis querem negociar. Mas os personagens sempre podem dizer "Não estamos interessados" e recusar a Negociação.

### Parar Combate, Iniciar Negociação

Se um herói quiser interromper as hostilidades para negociar com o inimigo, pode usar uma Manobra para fazer um Teste Difícil de Presença (ou outro Teste aplicável, a critério do Diretor), tentando encerrar o combate e iniciar uma Negociação. O Teste só pode ter sucesso se o Diretor acreditar que o outro lado está disposto e é capaz de negociar. Um inimigo que está em vantagem, que odeia os heróis profundamente ou que não tem inteligência suficiente provavelmente não vai negociar.

### Atributos Iniciais

Os atributos iniciais de Negociação de um NPC dependem da atitude dele em relação aos heróis, conforme mostrado na tabela de Atitudes Iniciais de Negociação, e podem ser ajustados pelo Diretor como achar apropriado. Um NPC naturalmente irritadiço pode ter Paciência menor, enquanto um NPC hostil, mas com grande interesse no assunto da Negociação, pode ter um nível de Interesse acima do normal.

#### Atitudes Iniciais de Negociação

| Atitude     | Descrição                                                                                                       | Interesse | Paciência |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Hostil      | Aberta oposição aos heróis. Mal disposto a ouvir.                                                               | 1         | 2         |
| Desconfiado | Duvida das motivações dos heróis, mas está disposto a ouvir.                                                    | 2         | 2         |
| Neutro      | Não sente nada a favor ou contra. Provavelmente preferiria estar em outro lugar, mas não quer ser rude.         | 2         | 3         |
| Receptivo   | Disposto a ouvir e ajudar, desde que os heróis não peçam demais.                                                | 3         | 3         |
| Amigável    | Os heróis parecem pessoas agradáveis ao NPC. Ele está disposto a lhes dar o benefício da dúvida.                | 3         | 4         |
| Crédulo     | O NPC tem motivos para acreditar na palavra dos heróis e ajudará se os personagens não estragarem a Negociação. | 3         | 5         |

## Descobrindo Motivações

Se um herói deseja descobrir as Motivações de um NPC, ele pode começar simplesmente perguntando “O que você quer com esse acordo?” Em resposta, o NPC pode voluntariamente dar pistas ou revelar uma de suas Motivações, geralmente pedindo algo em troca. Por exemplo, um monarca NPC com a Motivação de Ganância e gosto por colecionar animais raros pode sugerir que os heróis recuperarem um ovo de grifo lhes garantirá a gratidão do monarca. O Diretor também pode decidir que, durante o curso natural da Negociação, o NPC pode oferecer sugestões semelhantes sem que os heróis peçam, desde que o NPC já tenha um Interesse de 3 ou mais.

Se um NPC não for tão aberto ou se os heróis quiserem aprender uma das Implicâncias do NPC, um herói pode fazer um Teste de Razão, Intuição ou Presença enquanto interage com o NPC durante a Negociação, baseado nas táticas usadas para extrair informações do NPC. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** O herói não aprende nenhuma informação sobre as Motivações ou Implicâncias do NP, e o NPC percebe que o herói está tentando lê-lo, ficando irritado. Como consequência, a Paciência do NPC diminui em 1.
- **12-16:** O herói não aprende nenhuma informação sobre as Motivações ou Implicâncias do NPC.
- **17+:** O herói aprende uma das Motivações ou Implicâncias do NPC (escolha do herói).

Depois desse Teste, os heróis não podem fazer outro Teste para determinar as Motivações ou Implicâncias do mesmo NPC até que façam um argumento para o NPC ou a Negociação termine.

### Fora da Negociação

Enquanto os heróis podem descobrir as Motivações ou Implicâncias de um NPC por Testes durante a Negociação, eles podem usar outros métodos de investigação antes dela. Pesquisas ou um pouco de reconhecimento (por exemplo, ler o diário do NPC ou conversar com seus amigos mais próximos) podem revelar bastante sobre uma pessoa!

## Fazendo Argumentos

Como parte do pedido inicial a um NPC em uma Negociação, um herói faz um argumento para justificar por que o NPC deveria conceder o que eles querem. O herói pode oferecer algo em troca, como eliminar bandidos da floresta, entregar um tesouro ou matar um dragão para o NPC. Ou, em vez de oferecer algo, o herói pode tentar convencer o NPC de que ajudar é do próprio interesse dele — ou até mesmo uma obrigação moral. Por exemplo, um herói pode apelar ao senso de dever de um cavaleiro, à riqueza potencial que um mercenário pode ganhar ou ao último desejo da avó falecida de uma rainha como parte do argumento. NPCs que admiram os heróis tendem a responder melhor a elogios, enquanto aqueles que os temem respondem mais a intimidação e espanto.

Argumentos precisam de uma justificativa que explique o porquê são verdadeiros. “Ajudar-nos a derrotar o Lorde Saxton é bom para você no longo prazo” é metade de um argumento e o herói também deve explicar o motivo: “Ajudar-nos a derrotar Lorde Saxton é bom para você porque sabemos que ele vai atacar seu reino depois que Bedegar cair!” Se o herói fizer só metade do argumento, o NPC pode perguntar “Por que você diz isso?” ou “O que faz você pensar que isso é verdade?” para que o herói faça um argumento completo.

Um herói faz o argumento para o NPC, mas os jogadores podem discutir os detalhes do argumento fora de personagem de antemão. O grupo decide o quanto discutir antes de fazer um argumento que os jogadores acreditam que melhor convencerá o NPC.

Esse é um bom tema para discussão antes do grupo começar uma Negociação, para que todos saibam o que os outros pensam. Alguns grupos se divertem mais sem essa discussão, enquanto outros preferem planejar o máximo possível.

### Apelar à Motivação

Se um argumento não incluir uma Implicância e apelar a uma das Motivações do NPC que ainda não foi usada, o herói pode fazer um Teste Fácil para tentar convencer o NPC com esse argumento. Dependendo do argumento, pode ser um Teste de Razão, Intuição ou Presença usando qualquer Perícia aplicável — geralmente uma Perícia do Grupo de Perícias Interpessoais. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto.
- **12-16:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.
- **17+:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência não muda.

A critério do Diretor, um argumento muito bem interpretado ou fundamentado pode contar automaticamente como um resultado de Grau 3 sem fazer um Teste. Boa interpretação deve ser recompensada!

Se os heróis tentarem apelar a uma Motivação já usada, o Interesse do NPC permanece igual e a Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.

> **Apelando a Múltiplas Motivações**
>
> Se um herói fizer um argumento que pareça apelar a várias Motivações de um NPC, o Diretor pode pedir esclarecimentos. Depois de listar as Motivações que parecem ter sido usadas, ele pode pedir que o jogador escolha uma da lista. Se o jogador tinha outra Motivação em mente, cabe ao Diretor decidir se o argumento apela a ela ou não.

### Sem Motivação ou Implicância

Se um argumento não incluir nenhuma Motivação ou Implicância do NPC, o herói deve fazer um Teste mais difícil para convencer o NPC. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto e seu Interesse diminui em 1 ponto.
- **12-16:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto.
- **17+:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.

Se os heróis tentarem usar o mesmo argumento sem Motivação ou Implicância duas vezes, o Teste é automaticamente um resultado de Grau 1.

### Pego Mentindo

Se um herói mentir para um NPC com um argumento que não aumente o Interesse do NPC, o Diretor pode decidir que o NPC percebe a mentira e se ofende. O Interesse do NPC diminui em 1, além de qualquer diminuição causada pelo fracasso.

> **Todos Podem Participar**
>
> Como Razão e Intuição podem ser usados com Perícias aplicadas criativamente para fazer argumentos, todos os heróis podem participar ativamente da Negociação. O herói com maior Presença e a Perícia Persuadir não precisa fazer todos os Testes.

### Implicância Usada

Se um argumento usar uma Implicância do NPC, ele falha automaticamente e o Interesse e a Paciência do NPC diminuem em 1 ponto cada. O NPC pode avisar os heróis para não agirem assim novamente.

### Renome e Negociação

Renome determina se a fama (ou infâmia) de um herói tem qualquer influência sobre um NPC. A reputação de um herói pode tornar a Negociação mais fácil, desde que o herói saiba como usar isso.

Durante a Negociação, o NPC tem uma pontuação de Opinião que determina quanto Renome é necessário para influenciá-lo (veja Renome no Capítulo 13: Recompensas). Essa pontuação só importa se o NPC conhece os heróis. Um dragão que dormiu por cem anos e acabou de ser acordado para negociar não pode ser influenciado pelo Renome de um herói. (Aliás, acordar um dragão é uma péssima ideia, mesmo que ele saiba que você é famoso.) Se o NPC conhece o herói e sua Opinião é igual ou menor que o Renome do herói, ele pode ser influenciado pela reputação do herói.

Quanto maior a Opinião do NPC, mais difícil é influenciá-lo com Renome. Um bandido pequeno tem uma pontuação de Opinião menor do que um monarca que se reúne com pessoas poderosas e famosas o tempo todo. A tabela de NPCs e Opinião fornece exemplos de pontuações típicas de Opinião de NPCs. Se uma criatura tiver um Nível, sua Opinião é igual ao Nível, a menos que o Diretor decida o contrário.

#### Fama ou Infâmia?

Se um herói tem Renome suficiente para influenciar um NPC durante a Negociação, o Diretor decide se ele é famoso ou infame para o NPC. Se o NPC aprecia as ações do personagem e o vê como um herói que torna o mundo melhor, esse herói é famoso para ele. Se o NPC acredita que as realizações do herói pioram o mundo e o vê como inimigo, o herói é infame para o NPC.

#### NPCs e Opinião

| Opinião | Exemplo de NPC                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Líder de bandidos, plebeu, dono de loja                          |
| 2       | Cavaleiro, mestre local de guilda, professor                     |
| 3       | Líder de culto, mago conhecido localmente, nobre                 |
| 4       | Assassino, barão, artista famoso localmente                      |
| 5       | Capitão da guarda de uma grande cidade, sumo sacerdote, visconde |
| 6       | Conde, general                                                   |
| 7       | Marquês, artista de fama mundial                                 |
| 8       | Duque, chefe de espionagem                                       |
| 9       | Arquimago, príncipe                                              |
| 10      | Lorde demônio, monarca                                           |
| 11      | Arquidiabo, arquifada, semideus                                  |
| 12      | Divindade, titã                                                  |

#### Influenciando Testes

Se um herói é famoso para um NPC, ele ganha uma Vantagem em Testes ao fazer argumentos que possam usar as Perícias Flertar, Liderar ou Persuadir. Se ele for infame para o NPC, ganha Vantagem em Testes para argumentos que usem as Perícias Gabar-se, Interrogar ou Intimidar. O herói ganha essa Vantagem mesmo sem possuir a Perícia adequada.

## Resposta e Oferta do NPC

Após o herói fazer um argumento, o NPC responde em uma de três maneiras:

- Positivamente, se o Interesse do NPC aumentar. “Ótimo ponto.” “Você me deu muito o que pensar.” “Justo.” “Faz sentido para mim.”
- Negativamente, se o Interesse diminuir. “Não acredito nisso.” “Besteira!” “Entendo, mas discordo.” “Isso não me convence.”
- Com impaciência, se o Interesse não mudar. “Já ouvi isso antes.” “Vai me oferecer algo de verdade?” “Essa discussão é cansativa.” “CHATO!”

A menos que o NPC seja enganador, deve ficar claro para os heróis se o argumento funcionou, se precisam tentar outro ou se a situação piorou.

A resposta inicial deve vir acompanhada de uma oferta (ou recusa em fazer uma oferta) baseada no Interesse atual do NPC. Se o argumento de um herói fizer a Paciência do NPC ir a zero, o NPC avisa que esta é sua oferta final.

### Interesse 5 (“Sim e ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 5, ele oferece tudo o que os heróis pediram — e ainda melhora o acordo. Esse é o melhor resultado possível para os heróis. Se eles ofereceram serviços ou pagamentos, o NPC pode dispensá-los disso, deixando os heróis obterem tudo de graça. Ou ele pode exigir que os heróis cumpram suas promessas e ainda ofereça algo extra.

Por exemplo, se os heróis pediram ajuda de um chefe de guilda de ladrões contra Lorde Saxton, o chefe pode prometer enviar assassinos de elite para a batalha contra o nobre tirano e ainda dar uma aljava com flechas explosivas para dar vantagem na luta.

O NPC deve avisar que essa é a melhor oferta possível.

### Interesse 4 (“Sim.”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 4, o NPC oferece tudo o que pediram, mas sem melhorias. O NPC também aceita tudo que os heróis ofereceram como parte do acordo.

Por exemplo, se os heróis oferecem libertar um ladrão da prisão em troca dos assassinos da guilda dos ladrões contra Lorde Saxton, o chefe da guilda aceita os termos sem ajustes. A Negociação provavelmente termina aqui, mas os heróis podem tentar pedir mais se o NPC ainda tiver Paciência para outros argumentos. O Diretor pode incentivar isso com perguntas como “Há mais alguma coisa?” ou “O que mais deseja de mim?”

### Interesse 3 (“Sim, mas ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 3, ele oferece o que os heróis querem em troca do que ofereceram...e então pede algo a mais, como um favor ou pagamento extra. Por exemplo, se os heróis oferecem libertar um membro da guilda dos ladrões que está aprisionado em troca dos assassinos da organização, o chefe da guilda pode pedir que libertem mais um prisioneiro ou que ofereçam dinheiro ou uma arma mágica ao prisioneiro salvo.

### Interesse 2 (“Não, mas ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 2, ele não pode dar o que os heróis querem, mas oferece outros bens ou serviços menos valiosos em troca do que prometeram. Por exemplo, o chefe da guilda dos ladrões pode não estar disposto a mandar tropas contra Saxton, mas oferece relatórios de espionagem sobre Lorde Saxton em troca da libertação de um prisioneiro.

### Interesse 1 (“Não.”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 1, ele rejeita a ideia sem contraoferta. Se ainda tiver Paciência, pode tentar convencer os heróis a melhorarem a proposta, dizendo algo como “Por que arriscaríamos nossas vidas para ajudar a lutar contra Lorde Saxton? O que a guilda realmente ganharia, além de um fim rápido e brutal quando vocês falharem?”

### Interesse 0 (“Não e ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC é 0, ele não oferece nada, recusa-se continuar a Negociação e busca prejudicar os heróis. O NPC pode atacar imediatamente ou adotar outra abordagem, como espalhar boatos maliciosos sobre os personagens, enviar assassinos atrás deles ou tornar suas vidas difíceis. Se os heróis não quiserem estar em conflito com o NPC, precisarão oferecer um presente valioso ou cumprir uma missão para fazer as pazes.

É impossível continuar a Negociação quando o Interesse do NPC chega a 0.

## Continuar ou Parar

Se o NPC ainda tiver Paciência após fazer uma oferta e o Interesse está entre 1 e 4, os heróis podem fazer outro argumento para tentar melhorar o acordo. Ou podem aceitar a oferta e encerrar a Negociação. Deixe os jogadores decidirem isso. Você pode sempre indicar que o NPC ainda tem Paciência fazendo perguntas como “Há mais alguma coisa?”

Se a Paciência do NPC for 0 ou o Interesse for 5, a oferta feita é a última do NPC para os personagens. Os heróis podem aceitar ou não, mas a Negociação termina.

Se o Interesse do NPC for 0, ele encerra a Negociação sem aceitar acordo. Os heróis podem abandonar uma Negociação sem aceitar acordo a qualquer momento.

## Exemplo de Negociação

Depois de matar o verdadeiro senhor de Bedegar, o tirano Lorde Saxton tomou a capital da baronia e está reunindo forças para marchar sobre os outros assentamentos de Bedegar. Os heróis recentemente salvaram Edmund, o legítimo herdeiro do trono de Bedegar, e agora reúnem forças para formar um exército capaz de enfrentar Saxton e derrotar o tirano.

Os heróis estão negociando com Zola Honeycut, uma Humana chefe de guilda do Relógio — uma guilda de ladrões cuja sede fica na capital de Bedegar. A guilda se opôs abertamente a Saxton quando ele tomou o poder, mas o tirano rapidamente reprimiu todos os membros conhecidos do Relógio, forçando-os a se esconder ou enforcando-os como aviso aos outros. Os heróis esperam convencer Zola a apoiar sua resistência armada.

### Atributos de Negociação de Zola

Zola é neutra com os heróis no início da Negociação. Conhece-os só pela reputação, mas sabe que eles também acreditam que Saxton é um tirano que deve ser detido. Contudo, enfrentar esse tirano custou caro ao povo dela e ela não tem certeza se está pronta para voltar à luta. Um passo em falso pode significar o fim do Relógio!

> **Atributos de Negociação de Zola Honeycut**
>
> **Interesse**: 2 • **Paciência**: 3 • **Opinião**: 3
>
> **Motivações**
>
> - **Benevolência**: O nome de Zola, Honeycut, vem do fato de que ela sempre dá a seus companheiros uma parte maior do que a própria pelos trabalhos.
> - **Proteção**: Os membros do Relógio são a única família que Zola já teve. O lema da guilda é “O Relógio está sempre correndo”, pois estão sempre planejando o próximo golpe e seu futuro cada vez mais próspero. Zola não quer ser a última líder da guilda.
>
> **Implicâncias**
>
> - **Autoridade Superior**: Zola não quer servir a ninguém além de si mesma e despreza a ideia de receber ordens.
> - **Folia**: Zola é focada nos negócios e não tem tempo para frivolidades, especialmente sob a ameaça de Saxton.

### Interpretando Zola

Zola está feliz de que finalmente alguém está enfrentando Lorde Saxton, mas irritada que ninguém se revoltou juntamente do Relógio meses atrás, quando o tirano deu o golpe. Ela é passional sobre proteger seu povo, rápida para acusar planos perigosos em argumentos que não lhe agradam e rápida para elogiar argumentos com os quais concorda. Ela não tem receio de ser franca com os heróis, sabendo que eles compartilham o desejo de ver Saxton derrotado. Ela só não sabe se pode arriscar mais de sua família encontrada na luta atual.

### Negociação em Ação

Aqui está como a Negociação com Zola pode se desenrolar.

**Diretor (Djordi)**: As janelas estão tapadas, impedindo a entrada de luz na taverna Olho de Bode, aparentemente abandonada. O local cheira a madeira queimada, prova do incêndio que consumiu grande parte do interior há três anos. Quando a porta se fecha atrás de vocês, a luz de uma lanterna no outro lado do bar repentinamente preenche a sala. Entre as paredes e pilares enegrecidos, seis brutamontes cercam seu grupo. A Humana com a lanterna sorri. “Bem-vindos. Sou Zola. Willoughby me avisou que vocês viriam. Sentem-se.” Ela indica algumas caixas arranjadas em círculo ao redor de um barril largo.

**James (como Korvo, um Sombra)**: Sento-me e digo, “Korvo ao seu dispor, Sra. Honeycut. Estes são os melhores companheiros que um Polder poderia querer: Linn, Jorn e Val.”

**Diretor**: Zola acena para cada um, depois diz, “Perdão, mas vou direto ao ponto. Hoje em dia, não há lugar seguro para o Relógio. Estamos sempre em movimento. Então me digam, o que querem aqui?”

**Diretor:** Zola nods to each of you in Turno, then says, “You’ll excuse me
if I dispense with more pleasantries. These days, no place is safe for the
O Relógio. We keep moving. So tell me, what are you here for?”

**Alyssa (como Jorn, um Tático)**: “Estamos formando um exército para derrubar Saxton de uma vez por todas.”

Neste cenário, todos os heróis têm Renome de 2, exceto por Jorn, que tem Renome de 3, e é famoso para Zola.

**Diretor**: Zola ri sem humor e balança a cabeça. “Ah é só isso? Tenho que dizer, não acho que vocês quatro tenham muita chance. A menos que estejam escondendo uma legião ou duas de Anões nos bolsos. Sim, vocês têm Jorn, o Poderoso, mas precisarão de mais do que um guerreiro famoso para vencer.”

**Alyssa**: Ah! Então ela ao menos ouviu falar de mim! Obrigada, Renome.

**Grace (como Val, uma Conduíta)**: “Não temos. Mas temos Lorde Edmund — o verdadeiro herdeiro do trono de Bedegar.”

**Diretor**: Zola acena, impressionada. “Fico feliz que o garoto esteja seguro, mas ele é só isso - um garoto, não um exército.”

**Matt (como Linn, uma Talento)**: “Ele é um garoto ao redor do qual as pessoas vão se unir. Não temos exército, mas é por isso que estamos aqui. Queremos mudar isso. Pode ceder alguns soldados para nossa causa?”

A Negociação começa oficialmente. Os heróis disseram o que querem de Zola. O Diretor os convida a fazer um argumento.

**Diretor**: Zola se reclina sobre a caixa. “É isso aí. O Relógio sacrificou muito contra Saxton. Por que arriscar mais para ajudar? Ninguém esteve aqui por nós meses atrás, quando enfrentamos a tirania.”

**Alyssa**: Assinto enquanto Zola fala, ouvindo antes de responder, “Não soubemos da sua luta até que Saxton já tivesse enforcado muitos dos seus bravos. Estamos aqui agora. Como podemos ajudar?”

Antes de argumentar, Jorn tenta descobrir as Motivações de Zola perguntando diretamente. O Diretor decide revelar uma Motivação: Proteção.

**Diretor**: “Se eu fosse fazer um acordo com vocês, e isso é um grande ‘se’, precisaria de garantias de que vocês podem acabar com isso. Provas seriam melhores ainda. A proteção do meu povo é minha prioridade. Podemos conquistar a liberdade de Saxton assim que recuperarmos força.”

**James**: Ahá! Eu cuido disso. Subo na caixa e digo, “Podemos oferecer isso, Sra. Honeycut. Convencemos Lorde Edmund a conceder anistia a quem jurar servir-lhe.” Quero fazer um Teste de Presença para convencê-la.

**Diretor**: Espere aí, campeão. Os olhos de Zola estreitam enquanto você fala, e ela levanta a mão para interromper. “Não jurarei servir a nenhum governante, por mais benevolente que seja. Posso considerar parceria, mas até isso parece precário se você me pedir para me curvar de novo.”

Korvo inadvertidamente fez um argumento que usou uma Implicância, apelando a uma Autoridade Superior. O Diretor nota que o Interesse de Zola caiu para 1 e a Paciência para 2. Ela deu uma resposta firme de “Não”, condizente com Interesse 1, mas o Diretor formulou de modo que os heróis sabem que ainda podem tentar novos argumentos, pois a Paciência dela não acabou.

**James**: Foi mal! Achei que ia funcionar. Parece que Autoridade Superior é uma Implicância para ela.

**Grace**: Vamos tentar evitar outras Implicâncias. Val diz, “Desculpe, Zola. Não queremos lhe ofender mais.” Quero fazer um Teste de Intuição e usar a Perícia Ler Pessoas para avaliar a reação dela e tentar perceber outras Implicâncias.

**Diretor:** Legal. Dificuldade Difícil.

**Grace:** Tirei 17! Sucesso.

**Diretor:** Zola se recosta, dando uma risadinha. “Tem duas coisas que eu não suporto — qualquer um me mandando beijar um anel e aqueles tolos festeiros que preferem sair para beber do que lutar pela própria liberdade. Felizmente, vocês não são desses.” Dá para perceber que festas também não são bem-vindas por Zola.

Os heróis agora conhecem as duas Implicâncias de Zola: Autoridade Superior e Folia.

**Matt:** Linn vai dizer: “Estamos recrutando mais do que só o Relógio. Temos uma boa chance de recrutar os Elfos Silvestres e os Orcs da Floresta Rend. Também estamos treinando o povo de Valcovas para resistir. Se atacarmos antes que Saxton termine de montar suas forças, todos teremos uma chance maior de sobrevivência. Se você não ficar do nosso lado, Saxton ainda virá atrás de você. Ele já está vindo. O Relógio tem menos chances sozinho.”

**Diretor:** Acho que isso é um Teste de Razão, já que você está usando lógica para mostrar que juntos têm mais chance do que separados. É um Teste Fácil, pois está apelando para uma das Motivações dela.

**Matt:** Ótimo! Posso usar Liderança aqui, já que estou mostrando nossa capacidade de unir pessoas?\_

**Diretor:** Pode.

**Matt:** Tirei 14!

Como Linn apelou para uma Motivação, o Interesse de Zola aumenta para 2 e sua Paciência permanece em 2. O Diretor dá uma resposta “Não, mas...” baseada no Interesse de Zola. Nesse ponto, os heróis ainda não prometeram nada, então ela oferece algo de graça.

**Diretor:** Zola acena com a cabeça enquanto você fala. “Você está certa, mas não tenho certeza se tenho o pessoal para isso. Vou dizer o que posso fazer. Ainda tenho espiões vigiando Saxton. Posso lhes dar informações sobre os movimentos das tropas dele. Isso serve?”

O Diretor deixa claro na resposta de Zola que a Negociação ainda pode continuar, se os jogadores quiserem.

**Alyssa:** Acho que não, né?

**James:** Não. Precisamos de um exército.

**Matt:** Sim, vamos insistir.

**Grace:** Concordo.

**Alyssa:** Será que conseguimos descobrir outra Motivação dela?

**James:** Tem algo que eu saiba sobre a reputação da Zola? Eu tenho a Perícia de Criminalidade.

**Diretor:** Faça um Teste de Razão.

**James:** Tirei 18! Sucesso!

**Diretor:** Korvo saberia que Zola ganhou o nome Honeycut porque ela é generosa com os ganhos da guilda. Ela dá uma boa parte para todos os seus comparsas em cada trabalho.

O sucesso de Korvo revelou a Motivação de Benevolência da Zola.

**James:** Brilhante! Acho que eu teria compartilhado isso com o grupo antes da negociação.

**Diretor:** Sim, faz sentido.

**Alyssa:** Ótimo. Jorn vai dizer “Seria vantajoso de outras formas para sua equipe se vocês se juntassem ao nosso lado.”

**Diretor:** O interesse de Zola é despertado. “O que faz você dizer isso?”

**Alyssa:** “Mesmo antes do golpe, Saxton já tinha uma boa quantidade de riqueza. Se ele for deposto, essas riquezas precisam ir para algum lugar. O Relógio vai receber uma parte — uma parte bem doce, por assim dizer. Edmund também prometeu dividir a fortuna da família com qualquer um que fique com ele contra Saxton - sem juras de lealdade. Depois que o jovem senhor recuperar o trono, claro.”

**Diretor:** Você está apelando para uma das Motivações dela, então faça um Teste de Presença.

**Alyssa:** Posso usar minha Perícia em Persuadir também?

**Diretor:** Com certeza. E você ganha uma Vantagem porque é famoso para ela.

**Alyssa:** Eu precisava dessa Vantagem. Tirei 12!

Como Jorn apelou para uma Motivação, o Interesse de Zola aumenta para 3 e sua Paciência diminui para 1. O Diretor dá uma resposta “Sim, mas...” deixando claro que a Negociação ainda pode continuar.

**Diretor:** Zola pensa por um momento. Ela acena com a cabeça, “Estou começando a ver os benefícios. Acho que posso escolher algumas pessoas para ajudar vocês, mas vocês têm que ajudar eles primeiro. Veja, meus melhores guerreiros estão presos na Fortaleza de Bedegar. Eles devem ser enforcados daqui a dois dias. Se vocês os libertarem, eu vou garantir que eles fiquem ao lado de vocês contra Saxton. Estávamos fazendo um plano para libertá-los sozinhos, mas, francamente, precisamos de ajuda.”

**Grace:** Poderíamos pressionar o Relógio para fazer isso por conta própria, mas não consigo imaginar Val virando as costas para quem precisa.

**James:** Concordo totalmente. Vou parar de forçar a sorte aqui.

**Matt:** Isso significa menos tempo para recrutar outras tropas, então é melhor agirmos rápido.

**Alyssa:** Então estamos de acordo. Estendo a mão para Zola. “Fechado.”

Os heróis poderiam ter tentado conseguir um acordo melhor, mas estão satisfeitos com a oferta de Zola, então aceitam os termos dela. A Negociação acaba.

your own individual goals: uncover forbidden lore in ancient
tomes, forge weapons of great Poder, build ships that can sail the skies,
and more. Draw Steel ’s rules for downtime projects allow heroes to use
their time during respites to obtain important information, make new
Equipamento, and engage in other activities to Suporte their Aventurando.
```

Tracking Projects

```
You start a Projeto de Tempo Livre during a Descanso. You can start as many
projects as you like, but you can’t work on more than um project at a
time during a Descanso. Eventually, you’ll be able to hire criaturas who
can work on additional downtime projects for you.
You Rastrear project progress on your personagem sheet. As you work on a
Projeto de Tempo Livre, you Músculo look over old books that you’ve found in
your travels, perform experiments, converse with experts and scholars,
or work with tools to create something.
```

Project Prerequisites

```
All downtime projects have prerequisites you must meet before you
can undertake them.
```

```
Item Pré-requisito
Many downtime projects have um or more Especial items you must
possess or obtain before you can start the project. For instance, you
can’t build an airship without first finding a Wind Crystal of Quintes-
sence, a rare and key component in that vehicle’s construction. Other
projects have a Pré-requisito that involves undertaking certain activities
during the project process.
```

**Origem do Projeto**

```
To start a Projeto de Tempo Livre, you must have access to specific lore
detailing how the project is to be undertaken. This can take the form of
written information (a book, scroll, schematic, and so forth), an expert
tutor with wisdom to share, a master Artesão with skills to teach, a
Sobrenatural manifestation of the project’s scope and secrets, or qualquer
other form of the Diretor’s Determinação. This project-focused lore
is referred to as a Origem do Projeto. Not only do you need project sources
to start a Projeto de Tempo Livre, but you must have access to those sources
whenever you make a Lançamento de Projeto for that particular project (see
Lançamento de Projeto below).
Some project sources are relatively easy to find. Building a castle doesn’t
require tomes filled with ancient lore, but it’s also not something
every stonemason knows how to do. However, the location of the
Tumba de Ashrya, the mummified protector of um hundred slumbering
```

```
sorcerer-sovereigns, Músculo exist only in a single tome that requires an
accompanying adventure to unearth.
```

```
The idioma with which project sources are set down or can be shared
is chosen by the Diretor. The sample projects below have suggestions
using languages in Orden (see that section in Chapter 4: Antecedentes),
though you Músculo be able to find a version of a source in other
languages as well.
Whenever the Diretor determines that a criatura with needed
Conhecimento can be used as a Origem do Projeto, another Herói can serve as
this source of Conhecimento. However, they must use a Descanso activity
to be your Origem do Projeto whenever you make a Lançamento de Projeto related to
the project.
```

```
Procurar for Common Project Sources
If you need a Origem do Projeto for a particular project, ask your Diretor if
the source is common enough that it Músculo be found in a substantial
library, among a group of sages or guild artisans, and so forth. If the
Diretor says yes, then the next time you take a Descanso in a place with
a library or access to criaturas with the Conhecimento you seek, you can
locate the Origem do Projeto you need as a Descanso activity.
```

Lançamento de Projeto

```
As a Descanso activity (see Descanso in Chapter 1: The Basics), you make a
Lançamento de Projeto for um of your own projects. Alternatively, you can make a
Lançamento de Projeto to contribute to another Herói's project. A Lançamento de Projeto is a Teste
with a Especial outcome that isn’t divided into tiers. The characteristic
used in the Teste is determined by the project.
When you make a Lançamento de Projeto, the total—no matter how low—becomes
project points that are accrued by the project. Even if you have a
Penalidade on a Lançamento de Projeto, the minimum total for the roll is 1. If you
obtain a critical Sucesso—a natural 19 or 20—on a Lançamento de Projeto, this is
called a Avanço , and you can make another Lançamento de Projeto for the
same project as part of the same Descanso activity.
```

```
A Projeto de Tempo Livre is complete when it accrues project points equal
to or greater than its Objetivo de Projeto —the number of points it takes to
complete the project, noted in each project’s description.
As you work on a Projeto de Tempo Livre, the Diretor can add events that
help form the narrative of your research, crafting, or other activities.
These events Músculo provide unexpected benefits or challenges as you
work on your project, to help make the journey as dramatic as arriving
at the destination. See For the Diretor: Project Events below for more
information.
```

```
Lançamento de Projeto Edges and Banes
Since project rolls don’t use Sucesso tiers, they don’t follow the usual
rules for double edges and double banes. If you gain an Vantagem on a
Lançamento de Projeto, you add 2 to the roll, as usual. But if you have a double Vantagem,
you add 4 to the roll. Likewise, you subtract 2 from a Lançamento de Projeto that
takes a Desvantagem, and you subtract 4 from a roll that has a double Desvantagem.
```

**Skills and Project Rolls**

```
You can apply skills from either the crafting or lore Perícia groups to
project rolls that directly relate to a Projeto de Tempo Livre (see Skills in
Chapter 9: Tests). For example, you could use the Alfaiataria Perícia for
project rolls related to making a Magia Capuz, and you could use the
História Perícia while attempting to research the location of an ancient
battle where a Magia crown was lost. At the Diretor’s discretion, you
can also use skills from other Perícia groups, but a Perícia used for a project
roll must be directly related to the project.
```

```
idioma and Project Rolls
If you know the idioma of a Origem do Projeto, you can make a project
roll without qualquer issues. If you don’t know the idioma of the source
but you know a related idioma, the Lançamento de Projeto takes a Desvantagem. If you
don’t know the source’s idioma or a related idioma, the Lançamento de Projeto
has a double Desvantagem.
```

**Guides**

```
Heroes sometimes find guides—Especial books, schematics, Conhecimento-
able NPCs, Sobrenatural recordings, and so forth—providing important
and easy-to-understand information relating to a Projeto de Tempo Livre.
Each Guia has a Conhecimento value and a connection to a specific project
```

```
that greatly decreases the time required to complete the project.
When a Herói studies a Guia as a Descanso activity, they gain the Guia’s
Conhecimento value as project points toward its project. The Guia can’t
be used with that specific instance of the project De Novo, though it can be
used for a different project of the same Tipo.
```

```
Guides are awarded at the Diretor’s discretion, usually as a tool that
can be used to increase the Velocidade of complex projects for campaigns
with little downtime. For example, the Build Airship Projeto de Tempo Livre
has a Objetivo de Projeto of 3,000, requiring a fair bit of downtime. But if a
Herói finds a manual that describes how to craft an airship and grants
them 1,000 or more project points toward the Build Airship project, the
crafting time can be significantly reduced.
A Guia must provide its information in a idioma you understand for
you to gain its full Benefício. If a Guia uses a idioma related to um you
know, you gain only half the Guia’s Conhecimento value (rounded down)
as project points toward your project.
```

**For the Diretor: Project Events**

```
Project events are story events that present boons and challenges to
heroes as they complete research and crafting projects. These events are
entirely optional. If your group prefers a game where the heroes simply
work toward their goals by making project rolls, that’s fine. But using
these events can help a Diretor inject more drama into the processes
of research and crafting.
```

```
When To Use Project Events
Projects don’t need an event every time a Herói makes a Lançamento de Projeto.
If they did, the heroes would likely Gastar all their time trying to
manage their projects and never do qualquer Aventurando. Instead, you as
the Diretor pick um of the following methods to determine when an
event occurs during a Projeto de Tempo Livre. You can always Interruptor up the
method you use during a campaign, doing whatever you think works
best for the current situation.
```

```
Roll for Event
If you want events to be a surprise for you as much as for the other
jogadores, then once during qualquer Descanso when um or more heroes makes a
Lançamento de Projeto, roll a d6. On a 6, an event occurs. This is a good option if you
enjoy coming up with story on the Voar during play.
```

```
Event Milestones
If you want to guarantee that events occur during a Projeto de Tempo Livre,
use event milestones based on project points. When the project accrues
a certain number of points, an event occurs the next time a Herói wants
to make a Lançamento de Projeto. This approach works well if you want to plan
your event in detail before it occurs.
You can use the Suggested Event Milestones table to determine when
an event should occur during a project.
```

```
Suggested Event Milestones
Objetivo de Projeto Milestones
30 or fewer Nenhuma
31–200 um event halfway to the goal
201–999 dois events at um-third and dois-thirds of the way to the goal
```

```
1,000 or more três events at um-quarter, um-half, and três-quarters of the way to the goal
```

```
Downtime Projects
```

Whenever You Want
Whenever you think the heroes could use a little drama during a
Descanso, Jogar in an event. This approach allows you to plan an event
in detail when a Projeto de Tempo Livre starts, then deploy it at the most
dramatic moment—or even Jogar it in during an Encontro if you’re
feeling saucy!

Deploying Events
A Evento de Projeto occurs when a Herói makes a Lançamento de Projeto. You can roll for
or choose an event from the appropriate events prompts table, or use
the tables to inspire your own events. Each event entry on the table is
a narrative prompt written for you as the Diretor, and which you can
change and flesh out as you determine. Each event specifies whether it
occurs before or after the Lançamento de Projeto is resolved.

Automatic Avanço
If an event grants an automatic Avanço on a Projeto de Tempo Livre,
the project gains 20 project points and the Herói can make another
Lançamento de Projeto for the same project as part of the same Descanso activity.

Crafting Projects

Crafting projects enable heroes to create vehicles, Sobrenatural
treasures, and more. When you start a Projeto de Criação, other criaturas
can also work on the project, using their Descanso activity to contribute a
Lançamento de Projeto in Ordem to get the work done faster.

Unless a project has a event table of its own, the Diretor uses the
Crafting and Research Events table for Projeto de Criação events.

**Build Airship**

Item Pré-requisito: Wind Crystal of Quintessência
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Low Rhyvian
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Músculo, Razão, or Presença
**Objetivo de Projeto:** 3,000

When you start this project, you hire a crew of carpenters, mages, and
shipwrights who work in the Área where the project is undertaken,
with these artisans building the ship for you. You can make a project
roll whenever you are overseeing the project, which you Músculo be able
to do remotely through the use of Magia or Psiônica.

When the project is completed, you have an airship. You and qualquer
criaturas you designate can operate the ship by touching the ship’s
wheel. During Combate, a criatura touching the wheel can use a
Manobra to make the ship Mover up to 10 squares. The ship can be
moved only once per Ronda. Out of Combate, the ship has a Velocidade of 130
miles per day.

An airship is an objeto (giving it Imunidade a Dano all to Veneno and
Psíquico dano) and can take 200 dano before it is destroyed. If the
dano the ship takes is not too severe (as the Diretor determines), as
long as you have access to materials that can repair the ship, you can
restore it back to its original Condição as a Descanso activity.

```
Build or Repair Road
Item Pré-requisito: três writs of approval, from an engineers’ guild, a
masons’ guild, and a guards’ guild
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Caeliano
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Músculo, Razão, or Presença
Objetivo de Projeto: Varies
When you start this project, you hire a crew of masons, engineers, and
guards who start work at the location where the project begins and build
or repair the road for you. You can make a Lançamento de Projeto whenever you are
overseeing the project, whether you do so in person or remotely through
the use of Magia or Psiônica.
```

```
The number of project points required to complete work on the road
equals 10 × the road’s length in miles. The goal is cut in half if you are
repairing an existing road, or if someone else starts work on a second road
project that connects to your project.
When you complete the project, you earn Renome among people in the
Área where the road is built, depending on the length of the road.
```

```
Time spent traveling between locations on the road is cut in half. Access to
resources and Conhecimento is improved in locations along the road, giving
you and your aliados an Vantagem on project rolls to discover lore while you are
in those areas.
```

```
Build or Repair Roads Events
d10 Event
```

```
1
```

```
Before the roll, crews uncover an ancient road following the intended route,
crafted with remarkable techniques that make it a sturdy base on which to build.
The project gains an automatic Avanço and the Objetivo de Projeto is halved if it
was not already halved.
```

```
2
```

```
After the roll, the local population grows in excitement with each completed
portion of the road. The name of the Herói making the Lançamento de Projeto spreads as a
builder of bridges both literal and social. If the Lançamento de Projeto is 12 or higher, the local
community comes together to complete the project alongside the Herói’s hired
crew. The Herói doubles the Renome earned at the end of the project.
```

```
3
```

```
Before the roll, a local religious or civic authority hears of the project and sends
laborers to Acelerar it—in Mercado for a future favor. The Herói gains an
immediate 50 project points for the project if they accept the help.
```

```
4
```

```
After the roll, local hired hands and the project engineers find themselves at
odds, hindering the project. If the Herói can’t help defuse the situation, the project
requires an additional 50 project points to complete. 
```

```
5
```

```
Before the roll, supply caravans are disrupted by bandits, requiring extra guards.
If the Herói can’t deal with the bandit threat personally, the project requires an
additional 50 project points to complete.
```

```
6
```

```
After the roll, word is heard that not everyone in the local Área is happy about the
road being built. The project is hindered by Sobrenatural curses that cause stones
to Mover, vines and Matagal to reclaim sections already built, or churning
Terra to restore the road back to its previous form. The Herói must make amends
to the local Sobrenatural community or have the Renome earned by completing
the project not extend to that community.
```

```
7
```

```
After the roll, ditchers working on the project hit an ancient well, retaining Parede,
or Escondida stream that results in an immediate flood. The work is delayed, but
the new Água source ultimately provides a boon to local farming communities.
Project points earned by this roll are halved, but upon the project’s completion,
the Herói earns 1 additional Renome.
```

```
8
```

```
Before the roll, a new engineer arrives with Especialista experience such as building
sturdy wooden bridges, using bilge pumps to keep rainwater from slowing the
work, and so forth. They want to work on the project, but insist on receiving
a Consumível Tesouro first. If they are hired, the project gains an automatic
Avanço.
```

```
9
```

```
Before the roll, the proposed road touches on a Sobrenatural intersection—a
crossing place between multiple worlds that draws Interesse from a powerful Diabo.
The completion of the project becomes the personal Interesse of this being, who
offers to increase progress—but demands a future favor from the Herói. If the deal
is accepted, each Lançamento de Projeto for the project is doubled until its completion.
```

```
10
```

```
After the roll, a guildmaster has it out for the Herói. Whether from a past conflict or
something about the way this project has unfolded, the guildmaster has made it
their mission to hinder the project by dragging the Herói’s name through the mud.
The Herói’s Renome is treated as 1 less than usual while these Boatos persist.

Craft Teleportation Platform
Item Pré-requisito: um spatial navigator
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Voll
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Razão
Objetivo de Projeto: 1,500
```

```
When you complete this project, you end up with a 3-Quadrado-by-3-
Quadrado teleportation platform activated by a Sobrenatural password.
The platform is permanently affixed to the Chão in the location
where you create it. qualquer criatura with the password can use the
teleportation platform to instantly Teleportar-se qualquer criaturas or objetos on
the platform to a location they know, including another teleportation
platform whose Sobrenatural password they know. You and qualquer
criatura you designate upon completion of the activity can change the
password as a Descanso activity.
Each time the teleportation platform is used, the chance of it malfunc-
tioning and teleporting criaturas or objetos on it to a random platform
increases by 1 percent (to a maximum of 50 percent). You can restore
the platform back to its original Condição and reset this chance of
malfunction as a Descanso activity.
```

```
Craft Tesouro
You can craft the items found in Treasures in Chapter 13: Rewards. Each
Tesouro notes its Item Pré-requisito, Origem do Projeto, Lançamento de Projeto charac-
teristic, and Objetivo de Projeto.
```

**Find a Cure**

```
Item Pré-requisito: Varies (see description)
Origem do Projeto: Nenhuma
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Razão or Intuição
Objetivo de Projeto: Varies
You research a cure for a disease, curse, or Sobrenatural affliction whose
text states that it can be ended by the Find a Cure Projeto de Tempo Livre. If
the affliction was caused by the innate Recurso of a criatura, you need
the remains of that criatura or another criatura of the same kind as an
Item Pré-requisito for crafting the cure. For example, you can research
the cure for the affliction of a Lobisomem ’s Mordida Amaldiçoada by studying the
corpse of qualquer Lobisomem, not just the um who did the biting.
```

```
The number of project points it takes to complete this project is equal
to 50 times the Nível of the criatura who caused the affliction. If the
affliction was created by an environmental or Sobrenatural Efeito,
that Efeito notes the Item Pré-requisito and project points required to
complete this project.
When you complete this project, you craft um dose of an alchemical
cure for the affliction. Once the project is completed, you can craft
subsequent doses for the same affliction for half the number of project
points required for the initial project.
```

**Imbue Tesouro**

```
You can create leveled treasures by imbuing items with Magia or
Psiônica Poder. You must have a Mundano version of the item you plan
to imbue, such as a sword or Escudo, when you start this project.
You can imbue qualquer item três times. The first time you imbue it,
you pick a 1st-Nível enhancement. The second time you imbue it,
you pick a 5th-Nível enhancement. The third time you imbue it, you
pick a 9th-Nível enhancement. A Herói using armor or a Arma can’t
Benefício from an enhancement unless they are using a kit that includes
the armor or Arma Tipo, and their Nível matches the enhance-
ment’s Nível.
```

```
If an enhancement has a Roman numeral greater than I after it, such as
the Faseamento III enhancement, that enhancement can’t be applied unless
the item has all previous versions of the enhancement. This means you
can’t imbue armor with the Faseamento III enhancement unless it has the
Faseamento I and Faseamento II enhancements first. The effects of numbered
enhancements are cumulative unless otherwise noted.
Enhancements are broken out by item Tipo (armor, Implementos, or
Arma) and Nível. Each item Tipo and Nível features a table showing
the name, Item Pré-requisito, and Origem do Projeto idioma of each
enhancement. Imbued items take the Magia or Psiônica Palavra-Chave (your
choice) and are part of qualquer kit categories appropriate to the Tipo of item
(Armadura Leve, Arma Média, and so forth).
```

```
Imbuing Tesouro with Sobrenatural Poder as a Projeto de Tempo Livre
typically means you undertake that project to make use of the Tesouro
yourself. As such, all the features of imbuing refer to “you” as the user of
the item. However, imbued items can be created for other criaturas, or
created by other criaturas and found as Tesouro.
```

```
Downtime Projects
```

Imbue Armor
Armor imbued with an enhancement grants you Especial benefits
while it is worn. Additionally, when your armor receives its 1st-Nível
enhancement, it also grants a +6 Bônus to Vigor. A 5th-Nível
enhancement increases the Vigor Bônus to +12, and a 9th-Nível
enhancement increases it to +21.

**Iridescente:** When you are the sole alvo of an Habilidade, you can use a free
Reação to reveal that the Habilidade was targeting an afterimage of
you in the same space as you. The Poder roll for the Habilidade is treated as

Victories.

**Resistência Mágica I:** Your characteristic scores are treated as 1 higher (to
a maximum of 2) for the purpose of resisting the potencies of Magia
abilities.

**Florecer de Urtigas:** Whenever you are Agarrado by an Adjacente criatura, your
armor sprouts toxic nettles. While that criatura has you Agarrado, they
are Enfraquecido.

**Faseamento I:** Once per Turno, you can Mover through 1 Quadrado of solid mat-
ter. If you end your Turno inside solid matter, you are forced out into the
space from which you entered it and you take 5 dano that can’t be
reduced in qualquer way.

**Resistência Psiônica I:** Your characteristic scores are treated as 1 higher
(to a maximum of 2) for the purpose of resisting the potencies of psion-
ic abilities.

**Veloz:** You gain a +1 Bônus to Velocidade.

highest characteristic score and you can Empurrar them 1 Quadrado.

```
Clothing as Armor Treasures
A Herói who has a kit that provides no armor, such as the
Artista Marcial or Atirador de Elite kit, can create and make use of leveled
armor treasures that imbue Mundano clothing with super-
natural Poder. At the Diretor’s discretion, heroes who don’t
use kits, such as elementalists and nulls, can also Benefício from
such treasures.

Research Projects

Heroes can undertake many different types of research downtime
projects, which can involve procurar out new lore, improving existing
Conhecimento with study, uncovering Boatos or secrets, and more.

Unless a project has a event table of its own or a Especial event entry,
the Diretor uses the Crafting and Research Events table for research
project events.

**Discover Lore**

**Item Pré-requisito:** Nenhuma
**Origem do Projeto:** Texts or Conhecimento related to the subject you
wish to research
**Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic:** Razão
**Objetivo de Projeto:** Varies (see the table)

If you want to Rastrear the location of a lost Tesouro, decipher a ritual, or
trace the lineage of a royal family to find the next heir to the throne,
you can start a Projeto de Tempo Livre to delve into whatever mysteries you
seek to unravel. You Músculo start a project to discover lore because the
information can’t be discovered through a single Teste, or you could do so
because you failed a Teste to Recolher information and now want to learn it
through research.

When you start a Projeto de Tempo Livre to discover lore, you choose the
lore you want investigated and the questions you want answered. The
Diretor tells you if the lore you seek amounts to common, obscure,
lost, or forbidden Conhecimento. The more esoteric the Conhecimento, the
more project points are required to find the answers you seek.

```
Discover Lore Project Goals
Objetivo de Projeto
Common Conhecimento 15
Obscure Conhecimento 45
Lost Conhecimento 120
Forbidden Conhecimento 240
```

Common Conhecimento
Common Conhecimento is generally easy to discover with a day or so of
research. It’s not known by every passerby and takes time to uncover,
but with plentiful local sources for the information, you don’t need
to Gastar a lot of time searching. It could be that you need to question
several members of a rumor mill to figure out who a Nobre is not-so-se-
cretly courting, or you Músculo need to Gastar a few hours in a temple to
find the particular religious text that carries a seldom-used alternative
name for a deity.

```
Obscure Conhecimento
Obscure Conhecimento is known only to specialized sages and is typically
of Interesse only to those scholars. As such, precious few tomes are
written on obscure subjects. Finding the right expert to interview
or the best book to read typically requires several days of research.
Uncovering the details of a ritual used to Receptivo and close a portal to the
Sea of Stars isn’t easy information to come by, but there are people out
there who know how to do it—and who wrote the instructions down.
```

```
Lost Conhecimento
Lost Conhecimento is so esoteric that even among a field’s most dedicated
scholars, there Músculo be only um or dois individuals who have dug
deep enough to know that lore. Lost Conhecimento could come from a
time so long ago that only a single text in a dead idioma now holds
the lore you seek. Such lore often takes more than a week to hunt
down. The location of a legendary steel Anão ’s workshop is most likely
lore that is lost—except for um map Escondida in a private collection.
```

```
Forbidden Conhecimento
Forbidden Conhecimento is lore that a powerful individual or Organização
is attempting to keep secret. Those who know the secrets speak of
them in whispered codes after passwords are exchanged, and write
texts using ciphers. Hunting down leads and making sense of them
typically takes weeks. The location of the dagger that slit the throat of
the god of Morte is Escondida behind layers of encoded text and written in
a dead idioma known only to that god’s most devout followers.

# **Recompensas**

A virtude é sua própria recompensa... mas ganhar uma espada mágica também faz essa recompensa ainda maior. Conforme heróis se aventuram, eles encontram e criam tesouros enquanto recebem títulos, conquistam renome, atraem seguidores e acumulam riqueza. Esse capítulo apresenta todas as várias recompensas que um herói pode receber durante a sua jornada! Conforme ler as recompensas abaixo, anote os tesouros e títulos que seu herói gostaria de receber. Assim você pode buscá-los durante suas aventuras.

## Tesouros

Você ajudou a salvar o mundo! Ou pelo menos uma parte do mundo que é importante para você. Agora você merece os tesouros que vão ajudá-lo a ser ainda mais eficiente da próxima vez. Então pegue sua espada mágica, escudo psiônico e pó de catapulta, e cavalgue para a sua próxima aventura!

Tesouros são itens sobrenaturais que heróis encontram em suas aventuras, ou que eles mesmos criam para ajudar com seus feitos heroicos. Você pode reivindicar o chicote mágico de um capitão de bandidos, ou criar um colar psiônico que o ajude a derrotar um culto sinistro.

Tesouros tem várias formas e tamanhos, e se dividem em quatro tipos:

**Consumíveis** são os tesouros mais numerosos. Eles incluem poções, pós e outros itens que são consumidos quando ativados por você. A maioria dos consumíveis pode ser usada apenas uma vez!

**Adereços** são tesouros com propriedades sobrenaturais que não se exaurem. Eles incluem bolsas, botas, capas, luvas e jóias mágicas, entre outras curiosidades.

**Tesouros com Nível** são tesouros que se tornam mais poderosos nas mãos de um herói de Nível maior. Eles se conectam ao usuário, construindo um vínculo que alimenta o poder sobrenatural do item. Armaduras, implementos e armas são os tipos mais comuns de Tesouro com Nível.

**Artefactos** são tesouros de poder legendário que podem mudar ou influenciar uma aventura—ou mesmo uma campanha inteira. Cada um desses itens desbalanceados é único, extremamente desejado e muito bem guardado.

### Encontrados, Conquistados ou Criados

As regras do jogo trabalham com mundos onde as pessoas comuns—talvez até os nobres comuns—não tem fácil acesso a tesouros. Pode haver um apotecário na capital de uma região, mas eles vendem remédios naturais à base de plantas, não poções sobrenaturais. Em Vasloria, o ferreiro de uma cidade não vende maças mágicas, e o alfaiate não faz capas psiônicas. Simplesmente não há disponibilidade de tesouros para justificar sua comercialização de forma economicamente viável. Rumores se espalham sobre clubes misteriosos onde heróis e caçadores de tesouros podem se reunir para trocar itens, mas o risco constante de roubos faz esses locais difíceis de serem encontrados.

A maioria dos tesouros são encontrados durante aventuras. Muitas pessoas criam planos maléficos, mas apenas aquelas que tem a vontade e o poder para os realizar se tornam vilões—e adquirir tesouros de grande poder geralmente faz parte dos planos dos vilões. Por isso, os heróis que derrotam esses malfeitores geralmente reivindicam esses tesouros para si. Por outras vezes, generosos indivíduos abastados como monarcas e magos poderosos podem conceder tesouros como recompensa por feitos heroicos.

Heróis podem também criar os seus próprios tesouros, forjando as ferramentas que precisam durante sua jornada usando as regras do Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre.
Itens que podem ser criados tem seu item pré-requisito, origem do projeto, característica de
lançamento de projeto e objetivo de projeto(o número de pontos de projeto necessário para completar o projeto) especificados em suas descrições.

#### O que esse tesouro faz?

Quando um herói encontra um tesouro, eles descobrem as suas propriedades se o examinarem por 5 minutos ininterruptos, a não ser que a descrição do item diga o contrário.

> **Itens Pré-requisito de Tesouros**
>
> Cada tesouro tem um item pré-requisito necessário para criá-lo. A natureza exata de muitos dos materiais usados como pré-requisitos de itens são nebulosas para que o Diretor possa mais facilmente incluir esses materiais na campanha. O que é uma aranhamental? E quão rara é sua seda? Isso fica à discrição do Diretor, para que ele possa incluir itens pré-requisitos na aventura que está planejando ou criar toda uma missão secundária para encontrá-los.

#### Vestindo Tesouros

Muitos tesouros, como capas, jóias, chapéus e botas, devem ser vestidos. A não ser que o Diretor decida o contrário, esses itens supernaturalmente mudam de tamanho para servir a criatura que os veste.

Tesouros de vestuário tem palavras-chave que indicam a parte do corpo que devem adornar—Braços, Pés, Mãos, Cabeça, Pescoço ou Cintura. A palavra-chave Anel identifica tesouros comumente usados nos dedos. Você pode usar qualquer número de tesouros com a mesma parte do corpo como palavra-chave, desde que o Diretor considere razoável. Por exemplo, pode ser aceitável que um invasor do futuro com quatro braços use dois pares de braçadeiras, mas o Diretor pode decidir que esse mesmo herói não pode se beneficiar de duas capas ao mesmo tempo. Se o Diretor decidir que você está usando muitos tesouros com a mesma palavra-chave, nenhum desses tesouros funciona.

Ainda que palavras-chave indiquem a parte do corpo na qual tesouros devem ser vestidos, tesouros podem funcionar em outras partes do corpo. Por exemplo, um herói sem orelhas ou que deseja ter um visual diferente pode usar um brinco como um piercing em qualquer parte do corpo que deseje. Se um tesouro de vestuário faz parte de um conjunto, como um par de braçadeiras, botas ou brincos, todos os itens do conjunto devem ser usados para ganhar os benefícios do tesouros.

#### Empunhando Tesouros

Alguns tesouros são empunhados na forma de armas ou implementos. Uma arma pode ter a palavra-chave de Arma Leve, Arma Média ou Arma Pesada, ou pode ter uma palavra-chave denotando uma categoria específica de arma (Arco, Arma de Haste, entre outras). Um implemento pode ter a palavra-chave Implemento ou uma palavra-chave denotando o tipo de implemento (Orbe, Varinha, entre outros). Armaduras também são consideradas tesouros empunhados, com as palavras-chave Armadura Leve, Armadura Média ou Armadura Pesada; ou a palavra-chave Escudo.

Um herói pode empunhar tantas armas, implementos, armaduras ou escudos quanto puder viavelmente carregar ou vestir. No entanto, uma habilidade só pode se beneficiar de uma arma ou implemento ao mesmo tempo.

**Tesouros e Kits**

Para ganhar os benefícios de uma arma ou tesouro de armadura, o tesouro deve ter palavras-chave incluídas no equipamento do seu kit. Por exemplo, um herói usando o kit de Sacerdote Guerreiro pode se beneficiar do uso de tesouros de armadura pesada e empunhar tesouros de armas leves, já que eles fazem parte desse kit.

Se o seu herói não usa um kit, eles não podem se beneficiar de um tesouro de armadura ou arma, a não ser que eles tenham um recurso que diga o contrário, como a Prece da Habilidade Marcial dos Conduítas.

O bônus de dano de uma arma só se aplica a habilidades corpo-a-corpo se o seu kit tem um bônus de dano corpo-a-corpo. O bônus de dano de uma arma só se aplica a habilidades à distância se o seu kit tem um bônus de dano à distância.

#### Tesouros Mágicos e Psiônicos

As palavras-chave Magia e Psiônica em tesouros se referem a como esses tesouros foram criados, não a como eles são usados. Da mesma forma que poções e espadas mágicas não são limitadas para uso apenas por personagens que usam magia, as palavras-chave Magia e Psiônica não restringem o uso de tesouros para certos tipos de personagens. Portanto, implementos com a palavra-chave Magia podem ser usados para intensificar habilidades com a palavra-chave Psiônica e vice-versa. Tesouros que tem a palavra-chave Magia ou Psiônica e são usados para intensificar uma habilidade não adicionam essas palavras-chave a essa habilidade.

#### Bônus de Vigor e Dano

Se dois tesouros concedem a uma criatura bônus de Vigor ou bônus de dano lançado para suas habilidades, apenas o maior bônus se aplica a não ser que a descrição do tesouro diga o contrário. Bônus de Vigor e bônus de dano concedidos por consumíveis ignoram essa regra e podem ser combinados com outros bônus de Vigor e bônus de dano concedidos por tesouros.

### Consumíveis

Consumíveis são tesouros que podem ser usados por um número limitado de vezes antes de terminarem, perdendo suas características sobrenaturais. Você pode beber uma poção uma vez, e quando o fizer, ela é consumida. Outros consumíveis podem ter um número específico de cargas que podem ser gastas. Quando essas cargas terminam, o tesouro se torna inútil.

Consumíveis são organizados por escalão para facilitar a vida do Diretor quando so distribuir (Veja Escalões de Jogo no Capítulo O Básico). Como uma sugestão, um herói deve sempre poder encontrar tesouros consumíveis ou os materiais necessários para criar consumíveis do seu escalão ou inferiores. Por exemplo, heróis de Nível 5 devem poder encontrar consumíveis de 1º e 2º escalão. Em alguns casos, o Diretor pode decidir conceder consumíveis de um escalão superior ao dos heróis, mas essa escolha significa dar aos heróis mais poder do que as orientações de construção de encontros em _Draw Steel: Monstros_ consideram.

Seu personagem pode carregar qualquer quantidade de consumíveis por vez.

### Tesouros com Níveis

Como os adereços, tesouros com níveis podem ser usados à vontade sem que seu poder diminua. No entanto, tesouros com níveis se conectam ao usuário de uma maneira diferente dos adereços, se tornando mais poderosos e aumentando sua funcionalidade conforme você ganha Níveis.

#### Benefícios de Nível

Cada tesouro com níveis tem benefícios que você ganha nos Níveis 1, 5 e 9. Você não pode usar um benefício de tesouro até atingir o Nível apropriado. Benefícios de nível são cumulativos.

#### Carregue Três com Segurança

Sua conexão com tesouros com níveis não aumenta apenas a utilidade deles, ela também aumenta os riscos. Cada tesouro com níveis é uma entidade semisenciente motivada por propósitos próprios. Uma espada mágica deseja ser usada em combate. Implementos psiônicos anseiam por liberar seus fortes poderes. Por isso, uma criatura pode carregar com segurança no máximo três tesouros com níveis por vez. Se você carrega mais tesouros com níveis, esses itens ficam com ciúmes uns dos outros e brigam por sua atenção, tentando influenciá-lo subconscientemente a usá-los—e deixar os outros itens pra trás.

Não há problema em ter ou possuir mais de três tesouros com níveis, desde que os adicionais estejam armazenados em outro lugar ou na posse de outras criaturas. Porém se você carregar mais de três tesouros com níveis, você deve fazer um teste de Presença durante cada descanso:

- **≤11:** Um dos seus tesouros cm níveis (à escolha do Diretor) controla a sua mente. Ele força você a andar dormindo ou entrar em estado de transe e jogar fora o resto dos seus tesouros com níveis em lugares que você não lembra. Se você quiser recuperar esses itens, é melhor sair para procurá-los antes que alguém os encontre.
- **12-16:** Seus itens colaboram para impedir que você se mova até escolher só três deles e deixar os demais pra trás.
- **17+:** Nada acontece.

> **Você não precisa de três**
>
> Já que você pode carregar até três tesouros com níveis seguramente, é fácil presumir que seu herói precisa buscar três tesouros para usar. Na verdade, para a maioria dos heróis o ideal mecânica e tematicamente é carregar apenas um ou dois tesouros com níveis, não havendo necessidade de mais do que isso. Não há problema nisso! Você ainda será poderoso o suficiente com apenas um tesouro com níveis, principalmente se obter ou criar adereços e consumíveis que podem ter melhor utilidade para você.

#### Tesouros de Armadura com Níveis

##### Ladrão da Alegria

_Esse torque de cobre polido vibra com um senso de julgamento._

**Palavras-Chave:** Pescoço, Psiônica
**Item Pré-requisito:** Uma libra (453g) de penas, uma libra (453g) de tijolos das Sete Cidades do Inferno
**Origem do Projeto:** Textos ou conhecimento em Anjali
**Característica de Lançamento de Projeto:** Músculo, Razão ou Presença
**Objetivo de Projeto:** 450

**Nível 1:** Enquanto usa esse torque, você ganha um bônus de Vigor igual ao dobro do seu maior valor de característica. Além disso, você pode usar uma manobra para escolher uma criatura em sua linha de efeito e descobrir o Nível dela. Se o Nível dela for maior que o seu, o torque te causa inveja. Se o Nível dela for igual ou menor que o seu, o torque te causa desdém. Você pode ter inveja e desdém de criaturas diferentes, mas não mais do que uma instância de cada. Sempre que uma criatura dentro de 10 quadrados de distância de você causa dano a outra criatura você pode usar uma reação para gastar a sua inveja ou desdém. Se você gastar inveja, você causa dano igual ao dano desencadeador a uma criatura adjacente a você. Se você gastar desdém, você reduz o dano desencadeador pela metade. No fim do encontro você perde qualquer inveja ou desdém concedidos pelo torque.
**Nível 5:** O bônus de Vigor do torque aumenta para três vezes o seu maior valor de característica. Além disso, quando você usa a manobra do torque e a criatura alvo tem o Nível igual ao seu, você pode escolher inveja ou desdém.
**Nível 9:** O bônus de Vigor do torque aumenta para três vezes o seu maior valor de característica. Além disso, você pode ter múltiplas instâncias de inveja ou desdém, sem limites para ambas.

**Palavras-Chave:** Pescoço, Magia
**Item Pré-requisito:** Um capuz usado por um monarca assassinado
**Origem do Projeto:** Textos ou conhecimento em Caeliano
**Característica de Lançamento de Projeto:** Músculo, Razão ou Intuição
**Objetivo de Projeto:** 450

**Nível 1:** Enquanto usa esse capuz, qualquer criatura que causa dano a você é marcada para vingança até o fim do seu próximo turno ou até outra criatura causa dano a você. Qualquer golpe que você faça contra uma criatura marcada para vingança causa dano adicional igual ao seu maior valor de característica, e sempre que você causa dano a uma criatura marcada por vingança, ela fica sangrando até o fim do próximo turno dela.
**Nível 5:** Cada criatura que causa dano a você é marcada para vingança até o fim do seu próximo turno. Sempre que você causa dano a uma criatura marcada para vingança ela fica sangrando (até resistir).
**Nível 9:** Quando você tem três ou mais criaturas marcadas para vingança e você usa uma habilidade que tenha como alvo apenas uma criatura contra uma criatura marcada para vingança, essa habilidade tem como alvo todas as criaturas marcadas para vingança, independente da distância delas para você e mesmo que você não tenha linha de efeito para todas elas.

### Artefactos

Artefactos são tesouros poderosos, com campanhas inteiras podendo ser construídas em torno da busca, uso, ocultação, proteção ou destruição de um deles. Não duvide—esses itens desequilibram o jogo. Se os heróis ou vilões tem acesso a um tesouro assim, seu poder vai muito além do que as sugestões de criação de encontros em _Draw Steel: Monstros_ esperam. Isso faz parte da diversão!

Geralmente, uma criatura nunca tem posse de um artefacto por muito tempo. A maioria desses tesouros tem senciência própria e um desejo de seguir adiante. Já que muitas entidades poderosas podem querer se adonar de um artefacto, personagens podem encontrar exércitos, dragões e até deuses que venham retirar um deles de um usuário que se nega a entregá-lo.

#### Invólucro Mortal

_Essa hélice flutuante de metal dourado gira cada vez mais rápido após ativada, estalando com faíscas vermelhas._

**Palavras-Chave:** Psiônica

A mudança é o motor da existência. Permanência cria estagnação. Quando o passado se recusa a renunciar controle, um caminho precisa ser aberto para o futuro. Energizado pelo piscar das mentes e almas passando pelo vazio, o Invólucro Mortal explora o potencial entrópico inerente a cada criatura viva para projetar uma sombra capaz de derrubar até os deuses. Por que a verdadeira dádiva da vida é a morte, e dádivas devem ser compartilhadas.

Apenas alguém destinado à morte pode conter o poder do Invólucro Mortal. Uma criatura mortal que carrega esse artefacto serve como seu hospedeiro, ganhando uma ação adicional em cada um dos seus turnos, envelhecendo dez vezes mais rápido que o normal e se tornando incapaz de recuperar Vigor. Um hospedeiro sem tempo de vida natural máximo reduz permanentemente o seu Vigor máximo em 10 a cada ano.

Quando o Invólucro Mortal está desatendido ou na posse de uma criatura que não é mortal, ele se ativa e não pode ser desativado até que uma criatura mortal se torne hospedeira novamente. Enquanto ativo, o artefacto estende uma penumbra de influência por 10 milhas (16 km) em cada direção. Cada criatura na penumbra está sujeita aos seguintes efeitos:

**Pé na Cova:** Qualquer criatura na penumbra tem fraqueza a dano 2 e não pode recuperar Vigor.

**Morte Acelerada:** Cada criatura na penumbra envelhece 10 vezes mais rápido que o normal, e doenças e venenos que afetem criaturas na penumbra seguem seu curso 10 vezes mais rápido que o normal. Criaturas sem tempo de vida natural máximo reduzem permanentemente o seu Vigor máximo em 10 a cada ano. Cada criatura pode realizar uma atividade de descanso adicional durante cada descanso.

**Se você encontrar Deus na estrada, mate-o:** Cada entidade não-mortal na penumbra recebe a dádiva da mortalidade. Entidades normalmente imortais ou invulneráveis—tanto criaturas planares quanto os próprios deuses—podem ser mortos na penumbra, ainda que não necessariamente com facilidade. Qualquer criatura ou entidade que morre na penumbra do Invólucro Mortal experiencia morte perfeita. Ela está permanente e irrevogavelmente morta, e nenhuma magia, psiônica ou tecnologia pode ressuscitá-la.

**Moto-contínuo:** Se a qualquer momento não haja nenhuma criatura ou entidade dentro da penumbra do Invólucro Mortal, o raio da penumbra dobra de tamanho.

**Abjeto:** Deuses e seus servos sempre ignoram o Invólucro Mortal e seu hospedeiro—seja por incapacidade de percebê-lo, ou por não considerá-lo uma ameaça. Se o artefacto é destruído de qualquer maneira ou desfeito por poder divino, ele consome um ano de vida de cada humanoide na variedade onde foi destruído, e depois se reforma em um lugar escondido.

#### Lâmina de Mil Anos

_Essa lendária espada tem punho de luz estelar resplandescente do qual se estende sua lâmina de metal brilhante._

**Palavras-Chave:** Magia; Arma Leve, Arma Média ou Arma Pesada

Seja tirada de uma pedra, presenteada por um espirito do lago, forjada por um deus ou usada matá-lo, há uma espada que existe fora do tempo e do espaço. Ela sempre está onde deve, precisamente no momento necessário—depois some em um clarão quando a necessidade passa. Essa espada é retratada nas artes, músicas e histórias de várias culturas extantes—e ainda mais frequentemente entre culturas a muito extintas, geralmente após se provar o fator decisivo de alguma batalha. Ela foi empunhada por vários heróis lendários, e muitos outros que foram esquecidos pelas sombras da história.

Ainda que o seu tamanho e forma sejam debatidos, a espada é constantemente retratada com uma guarda de pura luz estelar. Quando empunhada, uma lâmina de metal brilhante salta do punho, de acordo com a preferência de arma do usuário. Aqueles que tocam a arma são tomados da vitalidade e poder dos heróis que a empunharam no passado.

**Perfeita para a Vitória:** Essa espada toma o tamanho, forma e aparência que o usuário deseja. Ela pode ser uma Arma Leve, Média ou Pesada, e o usuário pode mudar o tipo e aparência da arma com uma manobra livre. Qualquer habilidade de arma que causa dano lançado usando a Lâmina de Mil Anos ganha +5 de bônus de dano, e a habilidade sempre causa dano sagrado. Qualquer criatura com fraqueza a dano sagrado que sofre dano dessa arma também fica assustada e enfraquecida até o fim do próximo turno dela.

**Mobilize os Virtuosos:** Essa Lâmina enche o seu redor de esperança e coragem. Cada aliado, dentro de 1 milha (1,6 km) de distância da arma ganha vantagem em habilidades de arma e habilidades mágicas, e tem imunidade a dano 5. Além disso, cada um desses aliados tem Vigor máximo aumentado em 15 e ganha +15 de bônus de Vigor na primeira vez que é afetado por essa habilidade.

**Vire o Jogo**: Cada lacaio inimigo dentro de 1 milha (1,6 km) de distância da espada fica atordoado. Qualquer criatura Líder ou Solo nessa área tem desvantagem em lançamentos de habilidade.

**Garanta a Vitória:** Essa arma sempre aparece na noite de véspera de uma batalha que futuramente será considerada histórica. Ela desaparece depois de 24 horas ou quando a batalha é vencida, o que ocorrer primeiro. Ao pegar essa lâmina, o usuário entra involuntariamente em um pacto com a arma. Se ele não assegurar vitória contra probabilidades monumentais ou algum grande inimigo até a espada desaparecer, ele é puxado para dentro da espada, prevenindo qualquer chance de ressurreição, e o fadando a entregar suas forças aos heróis de outras eras para sempre.

**Alma de Mártir:** Se o usuário morre enquanto empunha essa lâmina, sua alma é sugada pelo punho de luz estelar, onde permanece até o fim dos tempos para prevenir qualquer chance de ressurreição. A espada desaparece, mas um persistente sentimento de esperança se espalha dos seus resquícios. Pela próxima hora, os efeitos da habilidade Mobilize os Virtuosos aumentam para conceder vantagem dupla em habilidades de arma e habilidades mágicas, imunidade a dano 10, Vigor máximo aumentado em 30 e +30 de bônus de Vigor.

#### Lumicetro

_Esse cetro cravejado tem um cabo espiral de porcelana que equilibra um orbe de luz sobre a sua coroa._

**Palavras-Chave:** Magia

Esse cetro espera alto no céu, descansando dentro de um furioso ciclone inesgotável. Ele espera por aquele que unirá todas as pessoas sob sua luz. Ele aguarda por seu campeão.

Dizem que o Lumicetro se manifestou pela primeira vez em um mundo novo fadado ao apocalipse—a não ser que todos os habitantes desse mundo se unam. Afirma-se que o cetro impõe domínio ou obliteração a qualquer ameaça que é cercada por sua luz. Atualmente, é geralmente visto como um mau agouro. Caso o Lumicetro se revele, as pessoas sabem que o mundo está à beira da destruição. Se qualquer dessas histórias é verdade, poucos podem dizer, por que os únicos sobreviventes que testemunharam o Lumicetro são os dragões em sono profundo.

**Presença Brilhante:** Aquele que empunha o Lumicetro sempre está envolto em um brilhante fulgor. Qualquer lançamento de poder feito pelo usuário que usa Presença automaticamente obtém Grau 3, ainda que o usuário possa lançar para tentar obter um crítico ou sucesso crítico.

**Laço do Campeão:** Com uma manobra livre, o usuário do cetro pode ativar uma linha brilhante de luz que marca o seu trajeto quando ele se move, ou desativar essa linha brilhante. Se o usuário cruzar essa linha, cada criatura e objeto cercados por ela e dentro de de 2 quadrados abaixo e acima dela são considerados laçados pelo Lumicetro. Criaturas permanecem laçadas até o laço ser solto ou até uma nova linha ser traçada.

**Domínio:** Cada criatura laçada pelo Lumicetro é imobilizada e não pode teleportar. Uma criatura laçada em voo fica onde está em vez de cair.

**Obliteração:** Com uma ação principal, o usuário ergue o Lumicetro ao céu. Cada alvo laçado pelo Lumicetro irrompe em uma explosão prismática de luz, sofrendo 10 de dano psíquico para cada quadrado horizontalmente cercado pelo laço. O laço então é solto imediatamente.

**No Fim do Mundo:** Se o Lumicetro não foi retirado do seu refúgio ciclônico com o propósito de derrotar um perigo terrível, um perigo terrível emerge para ameaçar o mundo dentro de 3 dias da retirada do cetro.

## Títulos

Títulos são benefícios especiais conquistados por heróis por meio de aventuras e grandes feitos. Heróis precisam ganhar títulos—alguns individualmente, outros como grupo—realizando tarefas heroicas. Títulos registram os feitos de um herói, formando a base das histórias contadas a respeito deles nas tavernas ou sussurradas nos salões dos poderosos.

Cada título vem com uma nova habilidade ou outro benefício especial. Conquistando títulos os heróis ganham um conjunto único de poderes que os distingue de outros aventureiros.

### Pré-requisitos de Títulos

Jogadores não escolhem os títulos dos seus personagens. Como tesouros e renome (na próxima seção), títulos devem ser conquistados. Cada título tem um pré-requisito único, de forma que conquistar um título pode exigir que seu personagem derrote um monstro específico, pesquise sobre conhecimento proibido ou—no caso do título de Monarca—conquiste um reino!

Títulos não são concedidos de forma programada. Em vez disso, o Diretor os concede quando heróis realizam um feito digno de recebê-los. Da mesma forma que o herói não encontra uma arma mágica automaticamente só por preencher os pré-requisitos para usá-la, ele não conquista o título automaticamente a não ser que seja concedido pelo Diretor.

Ainda que o Diretor conceda os títulos, se você deseja conquistar um título específico, diga para o Diretor. Por exemplo, você pode dizer: "Quero o título de Sangue de Dragão. O meu herói pode ficar atento para boatos de dragões que a gente possa derrotar?" Ter ambição é bom! Busque os títulos que você deseja para aprimorar o seu herói.

### Escalões de Títulos

Cada título é atribuído a um escalão de jogo onde é mais provável que seja conquistado. Por exemplo, o título de cavaleiro é algo que normalmente é conquistado no 2º escalão, mas se tornar monarca geralmente só é possível no 4º escalão. Porém, não deixe as regras atrapalharem uma boa história! Se o Diretor decide que o seu personagem se torne cavaleiro no Nível 1, desfrute dessa grande realização.

> **Para o Diretor: Concedendo Títulos Antecipadamente**
>
> Conceder títulos antes dos personagens alcançarem os escalões recomendados pode ser divertido, mas é importante lembrar que isso pode ter efeitos indesejados no jogo. Títulos de escalões superiores geralmente concedem benefícios mais significativos que os de escalões inferiores. Se uma heroína se torna rainha no Nível 1, suas responsabilidades reais podem ofuscar suas aventuras. Só antecipe um título por mais de um escalão se souber o que está fazendo!

### Personalizando Títulos

Essa seção detalha vários títulos prontos para uso. Porém, o Diretor também pode criar títulos personalizados, tanto para recompensar realizações específicas dos jogadores quanto para desenvolver organizações, localidades e inimigos do seu mundo. Quando um herói finalmente realiza um objetivo de longo prazo após muitas sessões de esforço, o Diretor pode eternizar esse momento concedendo um título único. Da mesma forma, o Diretor pode conceder títulos personalizados quando os heróis se associam a facções específicas, derrotam vilões infames ou aprendem novas técnicas de NPC's importantes.

A forma mais fácil de criar títulos personalizados é modificar os pré-requisitos dos títulos existentes para que se encaixem na aventura em questão. Por exemplo, o seu mundo pode conter uma organização secreta de revolucionários—os Arlequins—que não usam armas, derrotando inimigos com golpes desarmados e armas improvisadas. Criar um título de Arlequim pode ser tão fácil quanto mudar os pré-requisitos do título de Arruaceiro para “Lutar ao lado dos Arlequins contra um inimigo em comum.”

> **Para o Diretor: Aprimoramentos como Títulos Personalizados**
>
> Você pode transformar um aprimoramento em um título de 1º escalão criando um pré-requisito (veja Capítulo de Aprimoramento). Por exemplo, um herói pode ganhar o aprimoramento Familiar como um título se ele completar uma missão para para um arquimago que o ensine o ritual de conjuração como recompensa.

### Quantos Títulos?

Só por que um herói preenche o pré-requisito de um título isso não significa que ele é concedido. O Diretor decide quando o herói conquista o título e seus benefícios. Provavelmente você vai se aventurar bastante e estar qualificado para muito títulos, mas ganhar títulos demais ao mesmo tempo deixaria o seu herói muito complicado. Em geral, um herói normalmente conquista um título por escalão de jogo, ainda que ele possa receber menos ou mais à discrição do Diretor.

### Benefícios de Títulos

Alguns títulos tem apenas um benefício. Eles são geralmente conquistados individualmente por heróis ao invés de em grupo. Apenas o herói que realiza a pesquisa ou cumpre o destino especificado ganha a recompensa!

A maioria dos títulos, no entanto, são conquistados por todos os heróis simultaneamente pela realização de um grande feito, beneficiando todos eles. Esses títulos geralmente apresentam uma escolha de três ou quatro diferentes opções. Quando o grupo conquista o título, cada jogador decide qual benefício seu herói recebe. Por exemplo, se o grupo vence uma luta numa taverna e conquista o título Arruaceiro, um herói pode se tornar mais hábil na luta com armas improvisadas, outro pode aprender uma esquiva especial para usar quando flanqueado por vários inimigos, e dois outros podem simplesmente desfrutar da crescente notoriedade. Um herói pode escolher qualquer um dos benefícios de um título para o qual se qualifica, e vários heróis podem escolher o mesmo benefício.

### Concedendo Títulos

Títulos são recompensas por atividades heroicas, e eles geralmente são associados a tesouros e outros prêmios. Se o grupo derrota um monstro temível e conquista renome, ou termina uma missão e recebe um tesouro mágico com nível, um ou mais personagens podem conquistar um título simultaneamente.

Não há uma regra rígida para o número de títulos que personagens devam ter acumulado até determinado Nível. Se um personagem conquista um título sempre que realiza um feito realmente notável—uma vez a cada três ou quatro aventuras—então ele poderá receber um título por escalão. No entanto, seguir esse ritmo não é obrigatório. Personagens podem facilmente conquistar o dobro ou a metade desses títulos, os deixando um pouco mais ou menos poderosos do que o normal, respectivamente. O Diretor pode até mesmo ignorar títulos completamente se desejar.

> **Para o Diretor: Planejando Títulos**
>
> Enquanto dirige uma sessão de jogo, pode ser difícil acompanhar as ações dos heróis e lembrar quais títulos eles podem ter se qualificado para receber. Por isso é mais fácil planejar os títulos com antecedência. Se os heróis podem enfrentar um demônio ou dragão em uma futura aventura, você pode incluir os títulos Matador de Demônios ou Sangue de Dragão como possíveis recompensas além daquele capuz mágico ou adaga psiônica. Você pode até usar títulos como inspiração de aventuras. Quais desafios um herói deve enfrentar para conquistar o título Semideus?

> **Regra Opcional: Jogadores Escolhem Títulos
> **
> Se o Diretor não quer controlar os feitos dos jogadores, pode deixar que os jogadores façam isso. Nesse caso, sempre que um herói entra em um novo escalão de jogo, ele ganha um título à sua escolha para o qual ele tenha se qualificado.

> **Renome e Riqueza**
>
> Muitos títulos concedem renome, seguidores e riqueza aos heróis. Esses tópicos são tratados no final desse capítulo.

## Renome

Conforme realiza façanhas, sua fama permite que influencie NPCs e atraia seguidores. Sua infâmia entre seus inimigos também aumenta. Cada herói tem um valor de renome que representa como pode usar sua reputação para influenciar outras pessoas. Quanto maior o valor, maior seu impacto perante aqueles que conhecem a sua história.

No começo da criação de personagem, seu renome é 0. Algumas carreiras podem aumentar seu valor inicial de renome (veja Capítulo de Antecedentes).

### Aumentando Renome

Alguns aprimoramentos (veja Capítulo de Aprimoramentos), projetos de tempo livre (veja Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre), títulos e tesouros (parte do Capítulo de Recompensas) podem aumentar seu renome. Porém, geralmente você recebe renome ao fim de uma aventura emocionante, como forma de reconhecimento por um NPC poderoso do qual ajudou a salvar a vida, a família, o lar, a organização—ou mesmo a nação ou mundo. Esse NPC e qualquer outra pessoa que testemunhou seu heroísmo pode contar a história, e a partir disso, sua lenda cresce.

Na maioria das campanhas, o Diretor se prepara para que os personagens ganhem 1 Renome por Nível, mas algumas campanhas podem conter heróis que são mais ou menos famosos (ou infames) que isso.

### Influenciando Negociações

Renome altera a forma com que NPCs respondem aos heróis durante negociações (veja Capítulo de Negociações), independente desse renome ser por fama ou infâmia.

### Atraindo Seguidores

Seu valor de renome permite atrair e empregar seguidores que atuam em diferentes funções em seu nome. A **Tabela de Renome e Seguidores** mostra quantos seguidores um herói pode ter ao mesmo tempo com base em seu renome. Você sempre pode abrir mão de um seguidor para contratar um novo.

Você pode recrutar seguidores até máximo que seu renome permita como uma atividade de descanso, desde que esteja em um local apropriado ou tenha meios de comunicação que permita recrutar tais seguidores.

**Tabela de Renome e Seguidores**

| Renome | Número de Seguidores |
| :----: | :------------------: |
|   3    |          1           |
|   6    |          2           |
|   9    |          3           |
|   12   |          4           |

#### Fortaleza

Muitos seguidores ficam em sua fortaleza, que é sua base de operações, que você designa e pode substituir. Sua fortaleza é geralmente um local que compartilha com seus companheiros heroicos. Ela pode ser alguns quartos em uma estalagem de um pequeno vilarejo, um castelo antigo que tomou após esvaziá-lo de monstros, ou uma frota de navios.

#### Tipos de Seguidor

Quando atrai um novo seguidor, você decide seu nome e linhagem, e escolhe qual seu papel em serviço a você.

**Artesão**

Artesãos são especialistas em criação que podem contribuir em seus projetos de pesquisa e criação (veja Capítulo de Projetos de Tempo Livre). Um artesão pode contribuir com um lançamento de projeto por dia para um projeto de tempo livre da sua escolha, independente de ter passado o dia em descanso, aventuras ou outras atividades. Eles precisam permanecer na sua fortaleza ou no local onde o projeto está sendo realizado, e precisam ter acesso aos materiais necessários.

Quando você recruta um artesão, escolha as quatro perícias do grupo de perícias de criação que eles conhecem (veja Perícias no Capítulo de Testes). Um artesão tem valor de Músculo ou Agilidade igual a 1 (a sua escolha), valor de Razão igual a 1, e 0 nas demais características. Eles conhecem Caeliano e dois outros idiomas da sua escolha.

**Militante**

Militantes são NPCs heroicos que se aventuram com os personagens dos jogadores. Eles são controlados pelos jogadores durante o combate e são mais simples de usar e ao mesmo tempo menos poderosos que os personagens de jogador. Um herói só pode ter um militante em seu serviço por vez, a não ser que o Diretor decida o contrário. Já que militantes e suas fichas de criatura são focadas em combate, o Diretor também pode decidir que um grupo grande só pode ter um militante no total—ou que não pode ter nenhum militante—para evitar que os combates se tornem longos e tediosos.

Regras para militantes são encontradas em _Draw Steel: Monstros._

**Sábio**

Sábios são especialistas em pesquisa que podem contribuir em seus projetos de pesquisa e criação. Um sábio pode contribuir com um lançamento de projeto por dia para um projeto de tempo livre da sua escolha, independente de ter passado o dia em descanso, aventuras ou outras atividades. Eles precisam permanecer na sua fortaleza ou no local onde o projeto está sendo realizado, e precisam ter acesso aos materiais necessários.

Quando você recruta um sábio, escolha as quatro perícias do grupo de perícias de conhecimento que eles conhecem. Um sábio tem valores de Razão e Intuição iguais a 1, e 0 nas demais características. Eles conhecem Caeliano e dois outros idiomas da sua escolha.

## Riqueza

_Draw Steel_ não é um jogo sobre acumulação e contabilidade de cada peça de cobre que você adquire. Em vez de controlar uma conta bancária, as coisas que seu herói pode comprar são baseadas em seu valor de riqueza. Conforme realize façanhas, você adquire mais tesouros e recompensas de NPCs gratos que permitem que se torne um herói ainda mais eficiente.

A **Tabela de Riqueza de Herói** mostra os tipos de itens, equipamentos, serviços e propriedades que pode comprar no jogo. Para um herói fazer um compra, o item precisa estar disponível. Ter dinheiro para comprar uma armadura completa ou se hospedar em uma estalagem não ajuda muito caso esteja no meio de uma floresta densa, deserto desabitado ou ruína de masmorra remota. Da mesma forma, o Diretor pode decidir que um herói só pode fazer um número limitado de compras. Por exemplo, um herói com Riqueza 3 pode facilmente comprar uma pequena casa, mas essa riqueza não significa que podem comprar todas as casas pequenas nas redondezas para fazer especulação imobiliária.

A tabela não foi feita para ser um lista exaustiva, mas você e o Diretor podem usá-la para decidir o que seu personagem pode ou não pode comprar. Por exemplo, o valor relativo de um touro não está na tabela, mas podem presumir ser razoável que se você pode comprar um cavalo, também pode comprar um touro. (Não nos marquem, pecuaristas.) E se você não pode comprar algo, não se preocupe! Você pode adquirir algo através de uma negociação, ou trocando serviços heroicos em vez de gastar dinheiro.

Tesouros como espadas mágicas, coroas psiônicas e até poções de cura são raras ao ponto de não aparecerem na tabela de riqueza de herói. Tais itens geralmente não podem ser comprados, e em vez disso são encontrados em aventuras, trocados por outros tesouros, recebidos como recompensas por NPCs, ou criados pelos heróis.

### Ganhando Riqueza

Cada herói começa com um valor de riqueza de 1 que pode ser acrescido por sua escolha de carreira durante a criação de personagem (veja Capítulo de Antecedentes). Seu herói recebe riqueza sempre que encontra e fica com uma grande quantidade de tesouro pecuniário, como um tesouro de moedas e gemas de um covil de dragão, ou várias pinturas únicas e valiosas presentadas por um monarca como recompensa por um bom trabalho.

Em geral, um herói recebe 1 de riqueza a cada dois Níveis de jogo. O Diretor pode aumentar essa frequência se quiser.

### Perdendo Riqueza

Como regra opcional, o Diretor pode permitir que um herói faça uma compra acima do seu valor de riqueza. Se isso ocorrer, a riqueza do herói é reduzida em 1 (ao mínimo de 0) depois de fazer a compra.

> **Heróis Não Trabalham por Dinheiro**
>
> Em _Draw Steel_, ser um herói não é um trabalho transacional—é uma vocação. Por isso, usar promessas de tesouro para motivar os jogadores a aceitar missões acontece com menos frequência que em vários outros jogos. Claro, os heróis precisam de dinheiro para viver, e alguns podem até gostar de se tornarem ricos com suas aventuras. Porém, dinheiro não é o motivo para colocarem suas vidas em risco. Cada vez que cria um herói, pense sobre o que faz esse personagem responder o chamado da aventura—e escolha uma razão além de acumular ouro.

**Tabela de Riqueza de Herói**

| Valor | Pode Comprar                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Roupas mundanas, equipamentos, armaduras, implementos e armas; refeições e bebidas em tavernas comuns; hospedagem em estalagens comuns; passagem em navios. |
| 2     | Cavalo com carroça; jantares em restaurantes requintados; hospedagens em pousadas requintadas.                                                              |
| 3     | Catapulta; pequena casa                                                                                                                                     |
| 4     | Biblioteca; taverna; mansão; barco à vela                                                                                                                   |

| 6     | Castelo; estaleiro                                                                                                                                          |

# **Deuses e Religião**

rden is a fantasy world in which the gods are objectively real.
In spite of this the people of Orden, regardless of Linhagem, do
not believe the gods control everything that happens in the
world. They believe the gods created a natural world with its own
cycles that are sometimes predictable, but which cannot be
understood. It rained last Lyleth, and the Lyleth before that, so it’ll
probably rain this Lyleth—but maybe not! And if not, that may be
because the gods are displeased. But it Músculo just as easily be because
the gods are bored, or fickle or—even more likely, it has nothing to do
with the gods, and there’s no way to know which.

When a river floods or crops fail, some people may curse the gods, but
those people do not all believe a god caused these events. They may
curse simply because the gods didn’t prevent catastrophe. They do
not think, “Why did the gods do that?” They think, “Why did the gods
make a world that behaves like this?”

The gods are powerful, but forbidden from acting directly upon or
within the world. To enact their will, they use intermediaries—beings
of Semideus-like status, once mortals, who now serve their patron god
in eternity. Many humans call these beings saints, while the other
speaking peoples use the term heroes, or legendary heroes, not to be
confused with the heroes you make using the personagem Criação rules
in this book.

Each god has many saints, some obscure. They sometimes manifest
in the world. These encounters are always brief, Conduzindo sages and
theologians to conclude there must be some limit to how much time
or energy these saints and legendary heroes can Gastar on the prime
Variedade. Who created or enforces these limits?

No um knows.

As a result of this complex tapestry of belief and personalities, a Fazendeiro
in Aendrim Músculo call upon Adûn for strength while tilling the Terra.
But if a cool breeze suddenly came along, easing the Morder of the Sol on
their back, they would almost certainly not thank Adûn or qualquer of his
saints. They would probably thank Saint Elspeth the Blithe, sometimes
called the Summer Breeze. If they had a neighbor or relative with a
shrine to Saint Elspeth in their home, they Músculo give that person a
small gift or offering and ask them to place it on their shrine. More
likely, they would silently promise to do this, and then forget or get
Distraído.

If questioned about this—“Why did you call upon um god, but thank
the saint of a completely different god?”—they would first be Surpreso
by the question. It would not have occurred to them to examine this
behavior. If pressed they would say, “Oh, I’m sure they worked it out
between them.” They would not imagine, “Adûn told Viras, who told
her saint, Elspeth, to send a cooling breeze,” but they would assume

```
something like that happened and not worry overmuch about the
details. They called out, they received aid—that’s what’s important.
```

If no aid is forthcoming folks assume this is because the gods and saints
are all very busy and cannot be arsed to answer every Prece. People
are never Surpreso when the gods and saints are silent. They are
usually silent.

Churches and Temples
Most religions in Orden organize themselves into hierarchies and build
temples or cathedrals, but some religions are little more than traditions
handed down from shaman to shaman, or wise-woman to wise-daugh-
ter. Some religions are secret!

Because the gods are forbidden from acting directly upon the world,
churches and temples in Orden are consecrated to saints, or heroes.
There are no temples to Ord or churches of Cavall. Instead, there is the
Church of Zarok the Law-Giver and the Church of Saint Llewellyn the
Valiant. Everyone knows which god these heroes and saints serve, it’s
common Conhecimento. A Humano in Vasloria Músculo call out to Cavall for
aid in times of need but they know that, should Cavall choose to help,
it will be by sending um of his saints.
The most popular saints and heroes can have several churches—
meaning distinct organizations—devoted to them, each with their own
rituals. In Corwell, there is the Church of Saint Llewellyn the Valiant,
but there is also the smaller Church of Saint Llewellyn the Charitable
with only a few temples.

Usually, these churches recognize each other as expressing different,
equally valid teachings of the same saint, but occasionally churches
compete to see which among them is the “true” church. The saints
don’t discourage this, so they must, in some sense, approve.
There are churches dedicated to Natureza or Conhecimento or the Sol, with
no Tempo Limpo moral or ethical component to them. There are evil churches,
churches devoted to dark saints and tyrant gods. But the saints and
heroes listed here each have churches that, however esoteric their
teachings (usually referred to as the “speech” or “words” of the saint
or Herói) expect their clergy to go forth into the world and perform
good deeds—tend to the sick, ease pain, perform birth, Morte, and
union rituals. These churches all have Acólitos and abbots, censors
and conduits. It is not so much that Grole the um-Handed was, in
Vida, principally concerned with the spiritual wellbeing of his people ,
but rather that this is what people expect of churches. So, as a Religião
grows, it soon conforms to the expectations of the people such that
even the church of Khorvath Who Slew A Thousand has conduits who
Curar the sick and tend to the souls of their people.

Interspecies Worship
Elves, dwarves, and orcs revere their own creator gods. Val, Ord, and Kul
respectively. Humans, uniquely, worship many gods. The difference
between the Incontáveis Deuses Jovens of the humans and the Elder
Gods who created the other speaking peoples is not well understood.

```
Dwarves mostly venerate Anão heroes, humans mostly worship
Humano saints, and so on ... But this is just a side Efeito of the fact that
members of the same Linhagem share the same Cultura and idioma
and Personagem-assemble along those lines. qualquer sufficiently large city,
regardless of which species founded it, has churches and temples
to gods of many species because cities attract people of many
different species.
Each Cultura’s pantheon reflects the mores and folkways of the people
who live there. In far northern Vanigar, villains in folktales often gain
their Poder by tricking others through clever wordplay. Riddles.
Though they are villains, they are clever, and this earns them some
respect even from their inimigos. So the Vanigar pantheon includes
Holkatya, a trickster god.
```

```
Whereas Vasloria has no folk tradition of trickster figures, and so has no
trickster god. Instead, villains in Vasloriano folktales tend to be people
who seek quick ways to Poder in Ordem to avoid honest work. So
Vasloria has the dark god Cyrvis who teaches that Magia can subvert
Destino and make you master of not only your destiny, but also the world.
This also reveals the common Vasloriano’s Atitude toward Magia.
The gods of each pantheon tell you what the people of that region
value, and what they fear, disapprove of, or distrust. The Vasloriano
pantheon is wholly different from the pantheon of Vanigar which is
different from the pantheon of Rioja. The gods and saints can hear their
Adoradores anywhere in the timescape and even small cities can have
```

```
temples to distant gods of other peoples and regions. All it takes is um
dedicated Conduíta to establish a church of their saint or Herói in some
distant land.
```

```
For instance, A Alta Cidade de Dalrath, a small barony in northern
Aendrim, has a temple to Sektahre the Boatman, a saint of Khemhara, a
distant desert region. The people of Dalrath do not find this strange. The
priestess of Sektahre does all the same things qualquer native curate would
do: perform rituals, Curar the sick, and otherwise tend to the spiritual
and physical wellbeing of the locals without asking much in return.
Some people may be Desconfiado of a stranger peddling their Religião
far from home, but yet more people consider the Presença of such a
priestess a sign that their city must be very important indeed.
Because of all these gods and saints, Religião in Orden is a very à la carte
affair. There are Humano heroes in the elf pantheon. There are Anão
saints in many Humano pantheons. Elder or younger, the gods do not
care much about their followers’ biology. If you devote your Vida to the
teachings of a god and do good works in their name, you can expect to
be rewarded regardless of your Linhagem. And, though the Era dos Santos
is long past, most folk believe it is still possible for a mortal to ascend to
sainthood or herodom, even in this late age.
```

```
Lastly, though rulers across the land instinctively believe the gods are
paying more attention to them because they are queens or dukes or
the heads of a powerful wizard Ordem or guild ... there is no evidence
of this. As far as theologists can tell, the gods seem to view every soul
as equally worthy. Many of the Contos de Santos e Heróis Recurso
characters of enormous Poder Divino battling over the soul of a normal
person with no station or Poder or inheritance.
As much as it annoys the great and the good, the gods view all
mortals as equals.
```

Evil Gods and Saints

```
The gods and saints presented in this chapter are popular and
well-known. Their priests, shamans, or god-callers serve the public weal
and tend to the souls of the people.
But the world is not for heroes alone. There are villains, as well as those
who are simply misguided or desperate. Every pantheon has saints,
even gods, who teach the virtues of selfishness, cruelty, the pursuit of
Poder for its own sake, and the right of the Forte to do as they please.
```

```
These religions do not usually build public temples and worship in
the Receptivo, but most communities know, or very strongly suspect, who
among them serve evil gods and saints.
Among the people of Vasloria, there are the gods Nikros, o Tirano and
Cyrvis o Lich, evil gods, each with their own saints. When tyrants
rule, these religions tend to come out from the basements and sew-
er-temples and start worshipping openly.
```

Afterlife in Orden

```
Folk in Orden believe that most, maybe all, living things have a soul,
which is the source of personality, creativity, and memory. The loss of
um’s soul, either through bargaining with a Diabo, or being consumed
by a Demônio or otherwise trapped by a warlock, results in slowly losing
your personality, your distinctiveness—even memory.
However, there is no popular idea that everyone’s soul is immortal and
persists forever after Morte. Most people believe their soul dissipates
after Morte and becomes um with Criação. When asked where the
soul goes after Morte, the elf Sábio responded by blowing out a candle
and asking, “Where did the Fogo go?”
```

How To Use This Chapter
Draw Steel isn’t about Religião qualquer more than it is about
idioma or Tesouro, but understanding how Religião works in
a day-to-day sense can help make the game world feel more
real. The people in Orden aren’t qualquer more religious than the
people of Terra were in the premodern era. It is a factor in their
lives, but not the only factor—and for some people, not a very
important um.
Obviously, Conduíta and Censurador jogadores can use this chapter
to choose a saint, each saint’s entry also lists which domains
they represent. But each god also has a list of domains, so
an enterprising jogador could just invent a new saint, Herói, or
Arauto choosing dois domains from a god’s list.
But qualquer jogador Músculo wonder, “Does my personagem follow the
teachings of qualquer saint or god?” Think about the people you
know in the real world who wear religious or quasi-religious
talismans every day. A symbol on a necklace, a sticker on their
car, a tattoo. Normal people often carry religious talismans,
your personagem in Draw Steel Músculo not be particularly religious,
but they Músculo still carry a religious talisman just because it’s
a family tradition or to remind themselves of the religious
instruction they received in church as a child.
We wrote a lot of words in this chapter because we wanted to
give characters from all ancestries a few choices when it comes
to saints and heroes. But your personagem can ignore all of this if
you think Religião isn’t a big part of their Vida.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

In some cultures, exceptions are made for those mortals who lived an
especially virtuous Vida.

Much the same way the humans of Vanigar believe the bravest among
them live on after Morte drinking and telling tales at the Mesa de Guerra—the
wartable—most elves believe that should they live a Vida of sufficient
meaning, should they do great deeds and embody Val’s ethos, they
earn the right to join Val in Arcádia after Morte. There they will live in a
timeless faerie world, “the world that should have been.”

Most dwarves believe that those members of each generation who best
distinguish themselves earn the right to live forever in Ord’s memory.
This, they believe, is where their heroes go after Morte. Uniquely among
the speaking peoples, the dwarves believe their god is watching them,
watching the world. Ord cannot act, but he judges and remembers.

Some people in Orden, like the Hakaan and the orcs believe their
ancestors watch over them, although there is no agreement whether
their ancestor’s souls are watching over them, or just their memory.
Or something in between. Sages differ. This belief among the orcs and
Hakaan is more of an Atitude, an assumption, than a Religião.

Conduits and Censors

“Conduíta” and “Censurador” are not a titles within qualquer church—they are jobs
or ranks. An abbot, rector, even a bishop may be, or may have been, a
Conduíta or a Censurador. Conduits and censors are those members of the
church expected to go out into the world and actively, sometimes very
actively, represent their saint’s ethos. It is for this purpose conduits and
censors are given access to powerful prayers.

qualquer sufficiently large Organização has conduits and censors just like
they have shadows and wizards. The thieves’ guild needs healers, just as
the church needs spies! A Conduíta who works for the thieves’ guild still
serves their saint which implicitly means the church approves of the
guild’s activities and the dois organizations are at least pointing in the
same Direção if not actively allied.

Churches have bureaucracy just like qualquer Organização and while some
prelates, abbots, bishops, or hierarchs are conduits, many are not. They
are normal people who serve the church in administrative, political,
or Burocrática roles. While they know the same minor orisons every
Acólito and abbot know, they do not go out into the world righting
wrongs, and so do not gain access to the powers of the Conduíta or Censurador.

The prayers Acólitos perform in churches are little more than magical
rituals. They say the right words, make the right gestures, touch the
appropriate fetish or talisman, and wounds close, curses are lifted,
blessings bestowed. There’s no direct connection in these examples
between the Acólito and their god or saint. Though, even a lowly
Acólito can expect to find their prayers fall on deaf ears if they fail to
uphold the tenets of their faith.

Should the Acólito continue in their studies and deeds and earn the
rank of Conduíta or Censurador, they gain access to greater prayers granted
them by their saint. As they Avançar in their faith they call upon their
saint more directly, and they begin to form a personal relationship with
their saint. It is a feeling that develops whereby the Conduíta learns the ...
mood, for lack of a better term, of their saint or Herói.

As they gain experience, a Conduíta or Censurador may even enter into
dialogue with their saint. When they call upon their saint for Poder in
battle, their saint personally answers them. They Músculo literally be on
first-name terms. At even higher levels, conduits begin to get a sense
of the greater Poder behind the saint or legendary Herói: their god,
who begins answering prayers directly. They become, in Efeito, little
mini-saints. The pathway from high-Nível Conduíta or Censurador to saint is
now obscure, but was once well-known. In earlier ages of the world, it

```
was expected that certain Sagrado heroes who had served their god and
saint well would—should appropriately dramatic circumstances reveal
themselves—be elevated to sainthood.

Va l
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Vida, Natureza, Proteção
```

```
Val, the Nobre Lord, First Among Equals, is the patron of the elves.
He created the celestials—the elvos verdadeiros, second of the five speaking
peoples—who then created the younger elves: the high, wode, and
Sombra elves. His name is the root of the Caeliano word “valiant,”
and the dwarves named the most precious ore in Orden—Valiar, the
truemetal—after him.
Val holds that the greatest purpose a thinking being can commit
themselves to is the Criação of art and the appreciation of beauty. He
keeps the magical, elf-haunted forests called wodes close to his heart
because they represent his Visão for Orden. What the world could
have been. His growing disgust with the concept of Guerra led him to leave
Orden and take up residence in his private Variedade, Arcádia where all
elves hope to someday join their patron.
```

**Heroes of the Elves**

```
The legendary heroes of the elves are once-mortal heroes who now
dwell in Arcádia and make up Val’s court there. They answer prayers
and dispense blessings and boons, even manifest in the world during
times of great need. (Though, like all the speaking people’s saints and
heroes, what these legendary figures consider “great need” is very
personal and has little to do with politics or great kingdoms.)
The Alto Elfo heroes detailed in this book are A Sea of Suns, the Provar of
Morning, and Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold. The Elfo Silvestre heroes
are Yllin Dyrvis, Thyll Hylacae, and Illwyv li Orchiax.
```

```
A Sea of Suns
Domains: Criação, Vida
```

```
A Sea of Suns, also known as the Composer.
Credited with inventing harmony, it is said that after she discovered
the Poder of blending many voices into um, the elves sang for an entire
century uninterrupted 1. The harmonics so complicated they created
new beings like faeries, dryads, and the elgenwights.
```

```
The Composer discovered, or invented, the Poder of Música to
manipulate reality. Her troubadours, it was said, could return the dead
to Vida. “In the Música, you can live forever.” Legend has it she was at the
battle of Kalas Valiar when the first Exército da Noite besieged its walls.
When their Corrupção engines Enfraquecido the impenetrable walls,
she stood alone on the parapets and sang. For forty days did her Voz
bolster the walls, stemming the flood of evil. Her song ended only when
her Vida was taken by Um Coração Preso em Âmbar, the sorcerer-Assassino of
the star elves.
```

```
1 If this story wasn’t invented by the dwarves or humans, it must at least
have passed through um of their cultures. The celestials did not reckon time
the way younger species do and would not have said “for an entire century.”

Gods and Religião

The Provar of Morning
**Domains:** Criação, Conhecimento

The Provar of Morning, also known as the Librarian.

Credited with building the first library, most scholars consider this a
real, historical event (never a certainty with the tales of the legendary
heroes) and adventurers through all ages have sought this legendary
building. If, indeed, it was a building.

He canonized the idea that Conhecimento, truth, was a kind of beauty. The
Library of Morning was a temple to thought, wisdom, scholarship. It
contained plays, poems, histories, treatises on the Natureza of reality. The
Conhecimento held within was incalculable. Legends say it held codices
written by the elder dragons, though modern scholars suspect this is
a literary conceit, as there is no evidence the elder dragons bothered
with writing.

Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold
**Domains:** Vida, Proteção

Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold, also known as Warkiller, the
Diplomat, was both scholar, Sábio, and Soldado. She served as emissary
between the humans and the dragons when the former sought Guerra
against the latter. For many years she brokered Paz, but she could not
stem the tides of Guerra forever.

In the end, her efforts failed, and the elder dragons live no more in
this world. Like Val, the Diplomat hated Guerra so much, after her Falha
she sought to pen a new codex. A work so powerful it would bind the
world. The Codex Pax Universalis would Banir the concept of Guerra
from Orden. Alas, in the end she realized there was only um way to
finish her great work, and she was not willing to take that final step.

Yllin Dyrvis
**Domains:** Conhecimento, Natureza

Yllin Dyrvis, also known as the Fera Heart, the Wodespeaker, the
Guardião, witnessed the Composer’s first song, and took it upon
themselves to communicate with and care for the speaking criaturas
A Sea of Suns created. The dryads, elgenwights, the Gigante birds and
intelligent peixe who populated the ancient wode that once covered
all Orden, all came under the Fera Heart’s care. Dyrvis learned their
speech and taught them who they were.

To this day, many ages of the world later, A Silva elves consider
themselves the stewards of the speaking criaturas, and those criaturas
rely upon A Silva elves for Proteção.

Thyll Hylacae
**Domains:** Vida, Natureza

Thyll Hylacae, the Forestal, Apothachron, also known as the Sacrifício.
Thyll spoke to the plants, learned their truths—discovered many
magics Escondida within. The Poder to Curar, harm, change. It was Hylacae
who first sensed, then learned, the idioma of trees. She studied, cared
for them, and protected them when the folk of farm and field came to
cut them down.

Though she was mighty in warlore, she could not be everywhere. In the
end, she sacrificed herself for the trees, the ritual she performed uplifted
a small population of trees, creating the derwic—the thinking speaking
tree-peoples few of whom remain in Orden.

```
Illwyv li Orchiax
Domains: Natureza, Proteção
Illwyv li Orchiax, the Moonknight, Marshall of the Gloaming,
Manslayer. When humans first arrived in Orden—it is said—they were
welcomed by the other speaking peoples. But they were unlike the
other creations in the world. While the dwarves cut rock for the ore
within, humans cut down trees simply because they were in the way.
Other ancestries had their own territories and homelands, but humans
sought constant expansion into even the most inhospitable territories.
```

```
Illwyv it was who first realized the folly of treating with these criaturas. A
great Caçador of the Corte do Carvalho, she gathered her band of Elite Helriath
Harriers and made Guerra on the humans who would kill A Silva.
```

```
Ord
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Proteção, Sol, Guerra
```

```
Ord, the Maker, the Engineer, is the patron of the dwarves. Ord, along
with his siblings Aan, Eth, and Kul, created Orden. These four saw the
world as a dynamic expression of their philosophies.
Ord values integrity, honor, faithfulness to an ideal. Courage in
battle and fair play. Treating your opponent honorably, Ord teaches,
is an expression of your own worthiness. Ord is associated with
permanence, which some elder dwarves take to mean a kind of slavish
devotion to tradition. But Ord teaches permanence is the quality of
reliability, of steadfastness. Young dwarves who chafe at the stale and
stifling traditions of their elders remind the greybeards that Ord is the
Maker. He expects his children to create marvels, to bring forth new
discoveries, new insights. To remake the world anew each generation.
```

**Heroes of the Dwarves**

```
The following heroes are venerated by many dwarves and others
who follow Ord.
```

```
Zarok the Law-Giver
Domains: Proteção, Guerra
Zarok the Law-Giver. Zarok the Professor. Zarok who is Justiça.
```

```
The first, great Herói of the dwarves, Zarok was a noted general,
diplomat, and poet. In his time each Anão city-state had its own laws
which were mostly just lists of offenses with punishments listed next
to them. There was no consistency from um city to another and no
underlying theory of law. The Forte ruled, the rest obeyed.
It was after Zarok retired from his Carreira as a Mestre de Guerra and became
the ambassador to the elves that he undertook a study of how different
cultures express the idea of Justiça. He surveyed the various traditions
of elves, humans, and orcs and wrote The As Conversas —a series of
fictional dialogues in which dois characters, deliberately chosen from
Anão theater so as to be Familiar to his audience, debate the question:
“What are the characteristics of a just Sociedade?”
```

```
The As Conversas marks the beginning of legal theory in Orden. It
sought not only to state what a just Sociedade was, but to prove it ethically
through a series of logical statements. Most of the work concerns itself
with the proper, ethical uses of political Poder. The adversarial system
of legal representation is his.
Zarok teaches that all people should be equal under the law. His is the
principle of fair play—sportsmanship. Respect for your adversary. The
responsibility of the Forte to protect the Fraca.
```

```
Zarok’s The As Conversas are still quoted today. There is a long legal
tradition, when a prestigious lawyer in Capital wishes to write an
amicus brief without revealing their identity, they sign it “Z.”

Valak-koth the Seeker
Domains: Conhecimento, Sol
Valak-koth the Seeker, the Delver, the Fogo Inextinguível, Koth Who
Brought Luz to Darkness, said she heard voices in the rock as a child.
These days this would result in a visit to the apothecary or a change
in diet, but in those days the world was young and a child who heard
voices Músculo Turno out to be a prophet of Ord. Her parents listened and
soon Nenhuma doubted.
```

```
She would run, heedless of danger, into the dark caves below and
wherever she pointed, marvels were found: metals, gems, fantastic ores.
Caves as big as nations. It was Valak-koth it was who first discovered
Aerithyst, a Gema Solar, a crystal mineral which glows upon contact with
living things.
Valak-koth teaches bravery in the face of the unknown, the Virtude of
curiosity, to seek endlessly and quest for Conhecimento, not to fear the
darkness. To bring Luz into dark places. Valak-koth it was who first
discovered O Mundo Inferior, A Escuridão Abaixo de Tudo, though it was not
recognized as a separate Variedade until after her Morte. After her Morte,
the original Sungem she found refused to dim. It was enshrined in
her temple-tomb, now lost along with the ancient Pedra Anão city of
Kas Koriar.
```

```
Stakros the Engineer
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento
```

```
Stakros o Engenheiro, a Mente Máquina, o Operador, founder of the
Ordem da Fabricação.
Stakros it was— not a steel Anão—who forged the first strife-engine,
a great Guerra-walker manned by thirty dwarves. At the battle of Kalas
Mithral, the Guerra-walker grappled with the legion of yllindyr the star
elves summoned to defeat the walls of the steel Anão capital.
```

```
After the Guerra, Stakros turned his talents to peaceful pursuits. He forged
the first Mergulhador de Magma, designed to withstand enormous temperatures
and pressures, all the while protecting the Operador within. Inside
his marvel Stakros personally dove into the great volcano Oxor-myr,
returning with marvelous ores never before seen in Orden. His
design soon evolved into a variety of armored frames to suit a variety
of purposes.
Stakros teaches the value of Conhecimento for Conhecimento’s sake, and the
Poder of the mind to overcome qualquer obstacle. He also teaches that
Conhecimento is Poder, and in unready hands can only be dangerous.
```

Kul

```
Domains: Conhecimento, Vida, Sol, Trapaça, Guerra
Kul, Father of Flames, Lord of the Forge, the Cleansing Fogo who put Fogo
and magma within the world at its Criação.
```

```
He saw his sibling gods creating their own children and placing them
within the world, and so followed suit, creating the orcs, the last of the
original Cinco Povos Falantes.
Kul’s Fogo is the Fogo that destroys, but it is also the Fogo that creates,
the Fogo of the forge, the Fogo that makes meat safe to eat, the Fogo that
cauterizes wounds. Kul teaches that action is the defining characteristic
of being. Kul’s heroes are not philosophers or poets, but warriors
and hunters.
```

```
Uniquely among the Elder Creator Gods, Kul does not desire worship—
finds it distasteful. Orcs still call out to Kul in desperate times as “Kul
Who Once Spoke.” But in those moments, they do not call out for
aid—only that Kul witness them, and that they Músculo prove worthy of
his attention.
```

```
Heroes of the Orcs
The following heroes are venerated by many orcs and others
who follow Kul.
```

```
Khorvath Who Slew a Thousand
Domains: Sol, Guerra
```

```
When Khorvath, Líder de Guerra for the Elétrico orc clan set out with her
warband of bloodrunners, they numbered less than fifty. When they
finally arrived at the Cidade Solar, seat of the pharaoh of Khemhara, they
had grown to over dois thousand orcs from over thirty orc clans, all
eager for battle. Legends later swelled that number to ten thousand. 
Upon their arrival, the bloodrunners found their prospective employer
embattled and surrounded by inimigos, the pharaoh’s brother having
raised rebellion against him. Principally due to Khorvath’s help, the
pharaoh’s brother was killed and his army defeated. But the pharaoh
died in the battle, and Khorvath found herself and her warband
without a patron in an alien land surrounded by inimigos fighting a Guerra
of succession.
```

```
“What do we do, Líder de Guerra?” Her Capitão da Morte asked. 
Khorvath oriented herself and pointed northwest. “Home is that
way. We march!”
```

```
Capitão da Morte Voyrik’s eyes went wide. “It’s três thousand miles,” he
pointed out—and the journey to Khemhara had not been uneventful!
“Best get started,” Khorvath said, and set off. 
```

```
How long it took the bloodrunners of the Elétrico to cross the desert
is not well-attested. It took four or six months depending on which
accounts you read, but even six months would make their march a
legendary journey.
Opposed at every Turno by the local Nobre houses and then eventually
the desert clans who sought the bounty placed on Khorvath’s head, the
ten thousand grew in battle prowess as they demolished qualquer inimigo
foolish enough to get in their way. Given the many tens of thousands
of warriors the bloodrunners dispatched over the course of four (or six)
months, it may well be that Khorvath’s sobriquet was literal.
```

```
Sucesso was a double edged sword. The more victories they earned
in battle, the easier they were to follow. “Our inimigos Andar the red
road,” Voyrik once said, looking at the vast swath of blood they left in
their wake.  
“We have nothing to fear,” Khorvath said. “These people fight for
pride, or a bounty. We’re fighting for our lives. All it takes is um good
punch in the nose and they retreat.” And indeed this proved true
for many weeks.
```

```
Eventually três of the desert tribes allied themselves and this was a
coalition that could take a few bloody noses without giving up. They
cornered the bloodrunners in a ravine that led to a Montanha pass. It
was possible to Navegação the narrow pass, but only dois or três orcs
at a time. It would take hours to retreat that way. And the três tribes
blocked their way out.
Khorvath saw the way. She unwound her mother’s hand wraps from
her forearms and wrapped them around her own fists. The brown
stains on the knuckles made Khorvath proud.
```

```
“I will take the best Guerreiro from each of the 30 tribes,” Khorvath
pronounced, and word spread almost instantly. Within minutes, the
thirty best warriors among the ten thousand stood with Khorvath. “We
thirty will hold the pass.”
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

Capitão da Morte Voyrik, eyes wide, whispered Khorvath’s name.

Khorvath removed her torque of leadership and handed it to Voyrik.
“When you arrive home, give this to my son.” She looked at the torque
in Voyrik’s hands. “Tell him my last thoughts were of him. And that it is
my wish that this torque inspire him to great deeds.”

The tale of Khorvath’s Thirty is still popular among the orcs, though
everyone listening understands the “três days of Guerra” is pure fiction,
as Nenhuma of the thirty survived. It is nonetheless broadly taken as true.

Khorvath’s Thirty bought the bloodrunners the time they needed to
escape through the pass, and onward Desimpedido.

By the time they reached the eastern side of the Myr, Khorvath’s name
was already a legend, and many bloodrunners wore her clan fetish as
their talisman. Scaling the slopes of the Myr was not easy but as the
orcs descended down the western face, through the clouds, and saw the
endless sea of Verde that was the Great Wode, they cried out together
“Cekana! Cekana!” _The trees! The trees!_

The ten thousand were not home, but they were home free. For this
was territory held by their aliados. The church of Khorvath Who Slew a
Thousand spread quickly and now all orcs invoke her name whenever
faced with a seemingly impossible task.

Khorvath, like most orc heroes, teaches the Virtude of Resiliência. That
great problems are often just many tiny problems in Disfarce and that
by fighting each day as it comes, great battles can be won.

Khorvath Who Slew a Thousand would probably prefer to be
remembered as she was in Vida—Khorvath Who Brought Ten Thousand
Home, but even as um of the chief orc heroes, she has little influence
over the way the people choose to remember her.

Voyrik gave his Líder de Guerra’s torque to her son, who grew to Liderar the
Elétrico first as Líder de Guerra, then chieftain. He was a good ruler for
the Elétrico.

Grole the um-Handed
**Domains:** Vida, Guerra

Grole Uma Mão, Grole que Matou o Santo dos Crânios, lost his left
hand at Batalha de Dur Mothe where he stood alone against the Horda
of deathless and their master, the living saint Morath of Many Tendrils.
Grole thought to buy time for his army to escape the flood of Morte, but
when they saw their Líder de Guerra grappling alone with the Saint of Podridão,
they reversed their retreat. When Morath lashed out with his greataxe
Eviscerador and severed Grole’s left hand from his arm, Grole’s army
surged forward, breaking the tide of deathless.

His army watched as Kul’s Luz descended on their wounded Líder,
and they knew Grole had been chosen by Kul in that moment. At the
last, Grole and Morath fought as equals. Orc Herói and dark Humano saint
grappled atop the ancient hill. With his um good hand Grole plunged
the Fogo Verde, his grandmother’s saber, into Morath’s heart, ending the
Saint of Many Tendrils.

Grole teaches the extraordinary deeds common people can accomplish
if they cast fear from their minds. It was Grole who said, “Even should
an orc be pierced by many arrows, they should still be able to perform
um last act of revenge.”

Grole is the orcish Herói of those facing impossible decisions. He is
favored by most orcish leaders. Grole teaches that, even alone, even
against impossible odds, extraordinary victories are possible. Censors of
Grole often dip their left hand in ink before battle to symbolize Grole’s
missing hand.

Khravila Who Ran Forty Leagues
Domains: Conhecimento, Trapaça
Khravila Who Ran Forty Leagues, The Eternal Mensageiro, Khravila The
Implacável.
```

```
On the eve of a Guerra between elves and humans that would certainly
result in the Morte of many orcs caught between the dois great powers,
Khravila’s Morrendo father had been incapable of deciding what should
be done. Equally incapable of choosing who should succeed him as
chieftain—his son or daughter.
At the moment of his Morte, when the god-caller rang the bell of souls
officially announcing her father’s passing to the tribe, Khravila looked
at her brother and saw hesitation. Khravila had never known Dúvida.
```

```
She snatched her tribe’s oriflamme from her father’s dead hands ... and
ran. For many leagues she ran and the tales of the criaturas—manticores,
griffins, chimeras—who barred her passage passed into legend. Orc
children still delight at the tricks and wordplay Khravila employed to
thwart the beasts, avoid fighting, and continue her Épico run.
Less than five hours after her father died, Khravila arrived at the
Corte de Astragalus, forty leagues from home and while many elements of
her legend are certainly mythical, the time and Distância are well attested.
Khravila held forth the oriflamme and announced that, should the elves
continue their assault on the humans, there would be Guerra between them
and her tribe. “Chose quickly,” she said. “My people are right behind me,
and eager for battle.” They could not have known she was bluffing.
```

```
The elves called off their attacks and Khravila brokered Paz between
them and the humans. When her brother arrived with their kin folk
some hours later—itself an impressive feat—Khravila handed him the
oriflamme, and collapsed, dead. It was Khravila the chieftain who ran. It
was Khravila the Implacável who died, a legendary orc Herói.
Khravila teaches the Virtude of persistence, Resiliência, and—above all—
wits. Not only the wits necessary to Contraponto the tests that barred her way,
but to conceive her legendary plan in the first place, and the dedication
to Puxar it off. “Perhaps another orc could have run,” her brother said.
“But only Khravila could have bluffed.”
```

Heroes of the Hakaan

```
Most Hakaan in Orden are animists. They know and respect the four
Deuses Anciões who created the world and believe these gods watch the
world and see what happens within it. But the Hakaan do not create
churches or formal belief systems around this Atitude.
Instead they believe the world is filled with innumerable Natureza spirits.
Each river, tree, Pedra, has their own spirit, which the Hakaan revere.
They have no organized Religião in the way the other ancestries in this
chapter do, though a Hakaan brought up in a city, or among another
people, would naturally venerate in whatever gods and saints are
worshiped by the folk who raised them.
```

```
The Hakaan know they are descended from Pedra giants, but they do
not think of themselves as Pedra giants. They know their ancestors
were tricked by Holkatya, um of the gods of Vanigar, into trading
some of their great strength for the Presságio de Ruína. But while they respect
Holkatya, they do not worship her. Nor do they resent her. She’s merely
a detail of their História.
Hakaan conduits and censors venerate Hakaan heroes who, after doing
great deeds in Vida, were chosen by the gods to take their place among
the stars, becoming constellations. They see the stars at night as a
complex map of legendary Hakaan heroes, and their own ancestors
who watch from above.

Mahsiti a Tecelã
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Trapaça
```

```
Mahsiti a Tecelã was a fresco painter and mathematician of the
Hakaan who discovered, or invented, a way of drawing very precise
geometric shapes following patterns that repeat at qualquer scale. Believing
it could be a new way to devise spells, she took to weaving tapestries
using lines of thread to better understand the numerical relationships
within the patterns.
It took time to master weaving, but she took to it quickly and produced
a series of essays, each a tapestry, proving correct her suspicions. The
Tapeçarias de Mahsiti are a series of thirteen legendary artifacts of
varying sizes, um as small as a napkin, um over dois hundred feet long.
Each has a powerful spell written into it, available for use by anyone
who can read the patterns.
```

```
um of Mahsiti’s weavings, titled The Pastor e as Ovelhas , was used
by her whole clan when Guerra came to them. The Hakaan had no Dúvida
they could Defensor their home but were equally certain there would
be enormous loss of Vida. Mahsiti suggested they use the tapestry, but
the people of her clan did not understand. Use it how? It was simply a
picture of a tree in a field with many sheep gathered around it.
But this image, as Mahsiti showed, was formed out of thousands of
Repetidor geometric patterns. The tapestry had been a gift from Mahsiti
to her chieftain who hung it in their great receiving hall. Mahsiti cast
the spell within the tapestry—and walked into the tapestry. The people
were amazed and followed.
```

```
When the inimigo army arrived, they found the clan’s villages empty,
and did not notice the tapestry with hundreds of Hakaan depicted
within. Once the inimigo left, Mahsiti finished the spell, and her people
emerged, safe.
Mahsiti teaches that art and science, creativity and Conhecimento, are
the same thing. Those who follow her teachings believe that the act of
creating, of bringing a new idea or work of art into being, is the act of
participating in the same process the gods used to create the world.

**Prexaspes the Stargazer**

```
Domains: Natureza, Proteção, Sol
Prexaspes o Observador de Estrelas, o Astrônomo, o Sábio Solar mapped the skies
and was um of the first people in all Orden to correctly calculate the
Repetidor pattern of Orden’s três moons. Because of his growing
mastery of the cycles of Natureza, he predicted a coming famine
and prepared his clan. When the famine came but the people had
storehouses of food ready, he became a Herói of his tribe.
```

```
After receiving the Presságio de Ruína, Prexaspes turned his attention to the
Sol itself. He studied ancient tomes written by scholars of many
people, believing eclipses were predictable events. His research yielded
a pattern, but his Discernimento led him further. What if, he wondered, an
Eclipse was more than a celestial event? What if it was an opening, a
portal? Prexaspes studied the stars and prepared a ritual.
Years later, Prexaspes’ tribe was besieged by hobgoblins and all hope
was lost. He begged his chieftain to continue fighting—not abandon
their homes. The Astronomer promised an Eclipse, and though Nenhuma
doubted his calculations, no um could guess how this could help the
beleaguered and besieged people.
```

```
But the Hakaan trusted their Sábio, and kept up the fight. When
the Eclipse came, Prexaspes performed his experimental ritual
opening a portal to the Sol. A Linha of golden Fogo erupted from the
```

```
portal, evaporating many hobgoblins, but this was just a side-Efeito
of the ritual.
```

```
With his people watching, shielding their eyes from the brilliant Luz,
Prexaspes entered the portal, and emerged on the surface of the Sol. In
that moment, the people knew this was his Ruína. He was only gone a
few moments, but when he emerged from the portal his flesh was solid
sunstuff, and he waded into the remaining battalions of hobgoblins,
destroying them with rays of heat and purifying flame.
Though he died in the act, Prexaspes saved his people becoming a Herói
of all Hakaan, taking his place among the stars as a new constellation.
```

```
Prexaspes teaches that Natureza is a moral good and is worth defending,
and that the Sol is the source of Poder for all Vida on Orden.

Atossa the Shepherd
Domains: Destino, Proteção, Trapaça
```

```
The great dam built by their ancestors that created Lake Tospah was
going to fail, Atossa’s Presságio de Ruína said. The people would not listen, they
said she read the signs wrong.
When the rains came and would not stop, and the Água in Lake Tospah
rose putting more pressure on the dam, Atossa opened the gates to the
sheep pen and let the tribe’s herd of sheep out.
```

```
The people ran after them, effectively evacuating the village. But the
rains stopped, and the damn did not Explosão. The people returned to their
homes, put the sheep back in the pen, and blamed the shepherd for
worrying too much and Conduzindo them on wild goose chases.
The next year, the rains came De Novo. And this time the lake was already
near capacity. When the shepherd tried to warn the people, they
reminded her that it had rained the year before and there was no
danger—and so would not listen.
```

```
When the first cracks appeared at the base of the dam, Atossa knew her
Feitiço was before her. She took a piece of the broken dam back to the
village to show the elders. They frowned and wondered what Atossa
was up to now, but agreed amongst themselves to go up the valley and
inspect the dam in person.
Atossa tried to warn them they were walking to their Ruína, and
became even more agitated when the rest of the village followed. When
the elders reached the cracked dam, they sounded no alarm. Instead,
they argued and debated, “Chewing their beards”— rish javid —the
Hakaan say about elders who argue instead of acting.
```

```
Desperate, Atossa climbed to the top of the dam, and dove into the
Água, Nadador down to the bottom of the lake where she could see
the Pedra cracking. Her people were on the other side.
When the crack widened and Água began to pour through at
incredible pressure, the people panicked and ran. But Atossa was not
worried. This was her Ruína. She knew what to do.
```

```
She let the flowing Água carry her toward the widening crack until her
body slammed against the Pedra, Posicionamento de Palco the Água. The Hakaan are
famed for being able to hold their Sopro, but though her people ran as
quickly as they could, there was no way Atossa could block the Água
long enough.
When the dam eventually Explosão and washed away the village, the
people were not there. Atossa had bought them the time to run to
safety. They walked among the ruins and found her crushed body
among the rubble. They knew they would see her De Novo.
```

```
That night, there was a new constellation in the sky.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

Atossa teaches that it is not for the shepherd to judge the flock—only
to protect and care for them. Even though they Músculo be foolish,
or cowardly. “Let the gods judge,” Atossa said. “We have sheep to
worry after.”

Diabo Gods

Diabo heroes in Orden usually serve the gods and saints of the Cultura in
which they were raised. Few devils in Orden are from the Seven Cities,
most are descended from devils who were stranded on Orden hundreds
or thousands of years ago. Devils who are from the Seven Cities have
their own unique pantheon.

The Seven Cities have saints just like humans in Orden do but in place
of gods, these saints serve the seven Archdukes of Hell, also known
as Archdevils or the Lords of Hell. Unlike the gods of Orden, the Lords
of Hell are corporeal. Gigante figures, 30 feet tall, who each sit upon the
throne of their city, projecting their consciousness out into the world,
dealing with politics, sorcery, and treachery, manifesting avatars when
necessary. They are, effectively, the Gods of Hell.

Like the other gods of the timescape, the Lords of Hell are too busy
to attend to every petition and request and so employ saints just like
other gods. Religião in Hell is superficially similar to Religião among the
peoples of Orden. There are churches and rites and rituals, but devils
tend to view attending church and performing the expected rituals at
the appropriate times as akin to paying taxes. Annoying but necessary.

**Saints of Hell**

Like Orden, there are dozens of saints in Hell, some obscure. These
três are some of the most popular and the most likely saints for a
Conduíta or Censurador to follow.

Thellasko the Great Designer
**Domains:** Conhecimento, Guerra

Thellasko o Grande Desenvolvedor, o Mestre dos Jogos, Santo da Estratégia did
not invent Guerra—humans in Orden hold that honor. Thellasko invented
Guerra simulation. Creating what were effectively games to train cadets
and lieutenants at the wartable to ensure Vitória on the field.

Thellasko served in Dispater’s army, rising to the rank of major general.
He retired with honors after Batalha do Rio Rhye, intending
to take what he had learned on the field and write a book about the
proper way to conduct a Guerra.

He felt the high Comando of Hell’s armies fought battles on outdated
principles. Which side had the best fighting spirit, which side’s officers
had the greater Nobre pedigree. Thellasko’s treatise, never published,
was titled _The Proper Application of Force_. As he wrote, he created a
kind of ideal battlefield to use as his running example. The example
became more and more critical to the text, more robust, such that
eventually Thellasko put his manuscript down to develop the example
into a proper game.

This first game was played on a board of sixty-four squares arranged in
an eight-by-eight grid. There were dois armies each with sixteen pieces.
Eight serfs, dois soldiers, dois prelates, dois towers, a king and queen.
The game was superficially simple but held Escondida depths. It taught the
principles of Sacrifício and territory control, of thinking like your inimigo.

The game evolved into the game of _Shere_ , played throughout the
timescape. But while the game was immediately popular far outside its
intended audience, Thellasko grew dissatisfied with it, and began work
on his Obra-prima simply called _The Game of War_. It was complex,
using hexagonal tiles to build modular terrain boards, and featuring
dozens of different unit types with extensive tables that factored

```
supplies, morale, visibility. Unlike Shere, which was an abstraction, The
Jogo de Guerra was a true simulation.
```

```
Expensive to produce, The Jogo de Guerra was never very popular
outside the Academia de Dis, but Thellasko used it to train a generation
of lieutenants on the art of Guerra. His students and best jogadores led the
armies of Dis from Vitória to Vitória. Thellasko taught his students
that an army must fight. All other things being equal, the army with the
most experience wins.
In Thellasko’s time, the most senior Nobre was always the senior
Comandante, regardless of experience or, indeed, sanity. After Thellasko
and The Jogo de Guerra , commanders were chosen from among the
soldiers with the most battlefield experience.
```

```
Thellasko was granted sainthood on his deathbed after a generation of
successful battles won by his students, all of whom carried a symbol
of graduation from Thellasko’s school—três Adjacente hexagons. The
students praised him on the battlefield during his Vida, and his church
continues to Avançar his theories
Thellasko teaches the Virtude of accepting the battle as it is, not as you
wish it Músculo be. To take action based on available data, not what
tradition says. That wars are not won based solely on the Tamanho of um’s
army, but based on which side is best able to bring its force to urso
against the opponent.

Uryal the Subtle
Domains: Conhecimento, Trapaça
```

```
Uryal the Subtle, Deception, the Escondida Hand, Saint of Lies rose to the
rank of senior Adjudicador in the Bank of Vorilom in Styx. His manager
had been permanent undersecretary of finance for over três hundred
years, which Uryal felt was taking the Título a tad literally.
A dozen senior adjudicators had tried to usurp the permanent under-
secretary for generations. Their corpses made excellent lamps and
even better examples. But Uryal believed he was different. He knew
the game the finance managers played, and thought it was stale. Lying,
double-dealing, and backstabbing have their place, but there are even
subtler tools in the deceiver’s toolbox.
```

```
During a critical trading session, it was Uryal’s job to ferret out the text
of the upcoming Fruta-sangue futures report from the Ministry of Goods
and Services. Already an accomplished spy before he moved into
finance, this Uryal did easily.
Uryal faithfully relayed the contents of the report. Every detail,
unredacted, no embellishments. In other words, he told the truth. The
permanent undersecretary never considered this, and interpreted the
report assuming Uryal had edited it to favor his own placed wagers.
```

```
The permanent undersecretary ordered the bank to corner the market
on Fruta-sangue futures, believing the price would skyrocket. Uryal,
meanwhile, shorted Fruta-sangue. When the report was finally published,
saying exactly what Uryal said it would, the Bank of Vorilom was left
owing billions in futures trades, causing the entire bank to default.
The permanent undersecretary was, of course, fired. Literally. Uryal
awaited his promotion and counted the enormous sums he made
betting on cheap Fruta-sangue. He was not disappointed.
```

```
Uyral’s use of truth in a Guerra of lies attracted Moloch’s attention,
but lining his own pockets in the bargain and becoming um of the
single richest people in Hell earned Moloch’s favor. He raised Uryal to
sainthood and a privileged position in A Corte de Styx, a Cidade das Mentiras.
Uryal teaches that deception is only um tool in the art of lies. That the
point is manipulation , and that qualquer tool, including the truth, should
```

Draw Steel

```
be used to achieve um’s ends. Uryal teaches the Virtude of flexibility
of personagem and morality. The Virtude of unpredictability—always
behaving in a manner that is Receptivo to interpretation so as to prevent
your opponent from learning your tells.
```

```
Uryal is the Saint of Hell’s diplomatic corps. His unofficial motto, falsely
attributed to him but oft-repeated: “ Do unto the other guy as he would
do unto you. But do it to him first. ”
```

```
Kuryalka the False Principle
Domains: Morte, Trapaça
Kuryalka o Falso Princípio, Ladra de Almas, Audácia, Santa da Ambição is
credited with inventing the trading scheme known as the Esquema de Kurialka.
Daughter and eldest child of Orliath Ix—Marquis of Naraka, the City of
Blood—tradition held Kuryalka would ascend to the house throne upon
her mother’s Morte and rule, but from childhood Kuryalka was obsessed
with what was informally known as “the Comércio de Almas”—the buying and selling
of mortal souls from Orden and elsewhere in the timescape.
```

```
It occurred to Kuryalka that as long as people saw their soul-Poder
increasing on paper they wouldn’t inquire too closely about her
stewardship of their investment. They signed their accumulated
souls over to young Kuryalka, who promised them great returns. It
seemed too good to be true! But she published a report every quarter
showing marvelous gains, and while no um could understand her
math or references to “integrals,” they were well pleased with their
growing Riqueza. Whenever someone complained about the lack of
disbursements, Kuryalka would quickly pay them out of her growing
hoard of souls.
Of course, there was no investment taking place. She simply kept the
souls and grew in Poder, using new investors’ souls to pay out old
investors. She was not the first to use this technique, but she became
the most Famoso and successful—and the scheme was named after
her—because of um innovation. Kuryalka had developed an equation
that showed exactly when the ploy would collapse.
```

```
Days before that moment, supreme in the fullness of her soulpower,
Kuryalka did not Retirada her souls and escape into the timescape
with her near-infinite Riqueza. She went to the Archdevil Sutekh,
Lord of Naraka, and offered him her vast soul Riqueza in Mercado for
immortality and a place in the Court of the Seven Cities.
Sutekh’s Assustadora hollow laughter could be heard throughout Hell.
No mortal, he said, had ever embodied such naked ambition. He
accepted her offer, making her the first Saint of Hell. Sutekh took
Kuryalka’s souls and founded the Mercado, making the Comércio de Almas in souls
an official government department in Hell, and building an entire
bureaucracy around it.
```

```
Kuryalka teaches the Virtude of ambition—that if you are willing to risk
everything, you can gain everything. “The world is yours, if only you
tell a Mentir big enough.” That the greatest ambitions are those that are so
audacious, no um else has even imagined them yet. In this manner
does um avoid competition.
Kuryalka features in many folktales in Hell, including “Of the Childe
Whomst Kepte the Sheeps,” in which she appears to a young shepherd
boy warning him against getting caught telling his first lies. Kuryalka
instructs him in the proper use of manipulation: “ Never tell the
same Mentir twice !”
```

Humano Gods of Vasloria

```
Like all the Incontáveis Deuses Jovens, the gods of Vasloria embody
the attitudes of the people who live in that region. This includes the
humans, polder, and draconians of Vasloria.
```

```
Vasloria is a polytheistic, preindustrial, pre-Enlightenment, feudal
Cultura. Its people have many superstitions and prejudices, some of
which are reflected in the teachings of their gods. Adûn, for instance,
teaches that hard physical Operária is a moral good and people who work
hard every day are honest. Most people in Vasloria, especially Aendrim
where Adûn’s faith is most popular, believe this to um extent or another.
```

```
Some of them take it more seriously than others though. People in the
most distant villages tend to believe it more literally, while people in
the cities are perfectly aware than um may work and work and be a
Vilão. And this is true of most of the beliefs presented in this chapter.
Some people take it very seriously; some not so much.
Like all peoples of Orden, the people of Vasloria are well aware there
are other gods. They do not particularly think their gods are better ,
just, “These are the local ones who matter to us.” A priest of Cavall
who journeyed far from Corwell and found themselves in the distant
desert land Khemhara could still act as a Conduíta of Saint Llewellyn
the Valiant, but they would look around the Cidade Solar and see the
animal-headed gods of the Khemharans and the astonishing feats of
masonry and astronomy the Khemharans achieved and think: “Well.
Obviously the gods of Vasloria aren’t that big a deal here, but these gods
certainly are!” The peoples of each region of Orden prefer their own
gods because they understand them best, not because they think they
are “more powerful.”
```

**Adûn**

```
Domains: Criação, Vida, Amor, Proteção
Adûn believes that truth and hard work are virtues. He embodies
the Vasloriano belief that hard work is honesty. Someone who works
hard—real physical Operária—is an honest person. Anyone who does
no obvious work for a living is someone not to be trusted. Adûn is
more worshiped in the field than in the city. Farmers distrust city folk
because many of them make a living writing, or counting money, and
never break a sweat.
```

```
Vaslorians in remote villages still use the ancient Teste of strength to
determine truth. dois individuals in a legal dispute may find the reeve
asking them to fell a tree or build a Parede. Whoever finishes first is in
the right, because they worked harder and are therefore more honest.
Many walls and fields owe their existence to this ancient legal tradition.
A priest following Adûn expresses their faith through Operária. They build
things. Many priests are also masons or carpenters. Joining the church
for them did not mean abandoning their former Comércio de Almas. It intensified it.
```

```
A Cavaleiro following Adûn spends their time aiding others through hard
work, inspiring people to honest speech and hard Operária, as opposed to
Adûn’s brother Cavall who seeks to right wrongs.
Adûn and Cavall are brothers and the Linha between them is not a
sharply defined um. Truth and Justiça are close companions.

Gaed the Confessor
Domains: Amor, Proteção
```

```
Gaed o Confessor, filho de Malgen, filho de Germoc, was the abbot of a
small monastery dedicated to Saint Anthony—Escudo of the North—in
eastern Aendrim during the rule of the tyrant Barão Kaveran. Kaveran
was a secret Censurador of the church of Saint Pallad, winning the baronial
throne though a combination of treachery and good strategic battle
principles. Once on the throne, he threw off the black cloth covering
the device on his Escudo, revealing himself to be a servant of Pallad,
Saint of Nikros.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

Kaveran sought to consolidate his rule by extinguishing the church of
Santo Anthony, Escudo do Norte specifically, and worship of Adûn
generally. In this, he almost succeeded. Gaed’s monastery was small, his
province obscure. But as he refused to renounce his faith, his monastery
attracted more and more refugees, making it harder and harder for
Kaveran to deal with him without causing a revolt.

Kaveran abducted Gaed, his knights dragging the abbot out of his
monastery in the middle of the night, and tortured him for seven days,
hoping to break his faith and force him to convert to Saint Pallad. Gaed
neither renounced his faith nor called out for aid.

Kaveran was no fool, and knew killing Gaed would make a martyr of
him, and so attacked the abbot’s flock. Hoping—by putting their homes
to the Fogo—to pressure Gaed into recanting his faith. Kaveran barred
several families in a tavern, set Fogo to it, and brought Gaed to witness
the Horror.

But Kaveran had not thought to shackle Gaed, and the abbot countered
by lifting the bar on the Queimando building and walking into the tavern
in full view of hundreds of his followers. He spoke Saint Anthony’s
words as he did so, but it was Adûn who clothed him in a shimmering
blue Luz.

It was Gaed, son of Malgen, son of Germoc, who entered the tavern—it
was Saint Gaed the Confessor who emerged, unscathed, Conduzindo the
people inside to safety. In that moment the people and many of
Kaveran’s own followers turned on the cruel Baron, dragging him off his
cavalo and spitting his body with kitchen knives and pitchforks.

Gaed teaches the Virtude of being true to um’s principles even—
especially—when doing so is the most difficult thing in the world.
The Título “confessor” is granted to those who persisted in their faith in
public, even when doing so was dangerous or deadly.

Gryffyn the Stout
**Domains:** Criação, Vida

Gryffyn the Stout was an infant Anão when his parents’ cart was
waylaid by bandits who killed his mother and father, stole all their
wares, and set Fogo to the cart. They were unaware of the child
nestled within.

A nearby Fazendeiro saw the flames and rode out to investigate. When she
arrived, she could hear the bawling of the Anão babe. Though wreathed
in flame, the infant’s skin was too hardy to feel the heat. In the cavalo’s
Bando were a pair of tongs the Fazendeiro used to extract the child without
harming herself, and she took the baby Anão home to her husband.

Naming the child Gryffyn, the farmers raised him as um of their own.
The boy grew up wanting to be a Fazendeiro like his adoptive mother
and father, but they encouraged him to take up masonry, believing
stonework to be a natural part of his Linhagem.

Gryffyn had no particular aptitude for stonework, but desirous to
please his parents he worked hard until eventually he was apprenticed
to a mason and, after many years effort (more years than most, it was
noted) he produced his master work and became a master mason.

um day, years later after his parents had passed, hundreds of people
from other nearby towns and villages arrived at the quarry where
Gryffyn worked. Cinis the necromancer had discovered an ancient
tome of lore and summoned a Horda of ghouls. She used her new
army to conquer the surrounding barony, causing a flood of refugees.
Gryffyn’s quarry could not shelter a tenth this number of refugees, so
he proposed the people cross the White Ravine to the north and seek
asylum among the elves of the Corte da Orquídea.

Draw Steel

```
The people were appalled, the White Ravine was impossible to cross
for qualquer but the most experienced Caçador. “There is no choice” Gryffyn
said. “Cinis’s army will be here in a matter of days, and there is nowhere
else to run.”
```

```
The people cried and prepared for Morte. Gryffyn saw this, and his heart
felt like it would Explosão. “There are stones enough in the quarry,” he said
enigmatically. “Yoke the oxen and bring the stones to the ravine and
do not stop, even in darkness, even in rain, until the ghouls come or the
quarry is empty.”
When the army of Cinis the Pale arrived, the people fled to the ravine,
the path being easy as their carts and oxen had worn a Tempo Limpo road.
Thinking they would Jogar themselves into the ravine rather than be
eaten by the ghouls, they were astonished to discover ... the miracle.
A great Pedra bridge crossing the ravine. It had not existed três days
prior, and all agreed it could not have taken less than a year to build.
```

```
Fleeing across the bridge, the refugees found the body of Gryffyn,
author of this marvel, his fingers Sangrando, hammer in his hand, his
heart having finally failed. He knew his labors would cost his Vida. But
Arco de Gryffin still stands, almost a thousand years later.
Santo Gryffyn o Resoluto teaches that despair is the inimigo of action.
That unyielding Resiliência is the cure for impossible odds. That more
than sword and spell, hard work is the savior of the people.

**Cavall**

```
Domains: Vida, Amor, Proteção, Guerra
Cavall believes that mortals cannot live where injustice thrives. To
followers of Cavall, the unjust Sociedade is the Wasted Land, where people
live false lives. The concepts of civil law and just punishment are his.
```

```
A watchhouse chaplain is almost certainly a priest of Cavall. A rector
serving a small town may be welcome on the town council, but would
consider passing Julgamento on a fellow citizen a breach of duty. The
maxim of the church of Saint Gwiddon the Vigilant translates as: “To
watch, report, but not to judge.” The law, Cavall says, belongs to mortals.
Censors of Cavall, on the other hand, have no such motto. The nobility
often sponsor knights of Cavall to roam the countryside and dispense
Justiça in remote Selvagem areas where the Nobre’s influence
cannot Alcance.
```

```
Brother to Adûn and patron of the country of Corwell, Cavall also
believes that people, no matter how vile, can be bettered. “Let the law
judge,” said Saint Llewellyn, “Let us forgive.”

Llewellyn the Valiant
Domains: Vida, Proteção
Llewellyn the Valiant was a Cavaleiro in service to Duke Melianus of
Gant known as Melianus the Bright. His mother the duchess died
from a withering illness Nenhuma could cure, and Melianus, her only son,
assumed the throne.
```

```
Almost from the beginning of his rule, there were Boatos that a
sorcerer in the marsh was behind Melanius’s Poder, poisoning his
mother to hasten his ascent, but as the marsh was nigh impassable this
could not be proven and was taken for little more than a spiteful rumor.
Duke Melianus’s reign was cruel almost from the outset. He accused
all those loyal to his mother of treachery, and found occasion to have
them each imprisoned and executed without trial. Sir Llewellyn had
served the duchess loyally and strove to acquit himself of his duty
under the new duke. But he struggled to reconcile his sense of duty
with the new duke’s capricious Malícia.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

The new duke yearned to imprison his mother’s favored Cavaleiro, but
all the guards, the reeves, the people of city and village, looked up to
Llewellyn. Melianus instead contrived to send Sir Llewellyn on a series
of quests, each more deadly than the last.

The Trabalhos de Llewellyn, as they came to be known, passed into
legend and their tale is still told in Corwell. Llewellyn and the Dragão
With Seven Eyes, Llewellyn e a Bruxa do Pântano, Llewellyn and
the Onyx Tower.

When Llewellyn slew Ghruk a Bruxa Troll, she cried out, “Follow
Melianus!” as she died. These words echoed in Llewellyn’s ears and his
heart. He assumed she meant, “Obey him—be loyal to him.” But as he
rode his great destrier Silverheart back to Castle Gant, Llewellyn began
to suspect what Ghruk meant.

That night, Llewellyn waited in the stables and, at midnight, Melianus
appeared. He mounted his great black warhorse Carvão de Fogo and rode. To
where, Llewellyn could not guess. But the Cavaleiro followed the duke as
he rode east toward the marsh, he remembered the Boatos.

At the Vantagem of the marsh, Carvão de Fogo’s eyes began to glow with a baleful
flame and his mane Explosão into crimson Fogo. Llewellyn’s Sopro caught
in his throat. “A nightmare!” he realized. The Boatos were true! The
sorcerer had given Melianus a Diabo steed.

On flaming nightmare hooves was Melianus able to cross the
impassable Pântano. Llewellyn balked, no um could cross the Amaldiçoado
bog. But Silverheart champed at her bit, pulled on the reins. She would
not yield. Placing his trust in his steed, Llewellyn let the reins Mentir slack,
and Silverheart took the Liderar.

Llewellyn and Silverheart plunged into the bog and though it was night
and the mud sucked at her hooves, Silverheart pushed on. In the hour
before dawn, they arrived at an island with an ancient tower. “The tower
of the sorcerer,” Llewellyn thought. Thunder rolled, and rain began to fall.

Looking to the upper window of the tower, Llewellyn saw someone
performing a dark ritual. A flash of Elétrico Iluminado the figure. It
was Melianus! Melianus was the sorcerer! Llewellyn called out, and the
duke descended the tower and mounted his hellsteed. On his Escudo
now—the screaming-skull symbol of Cyrvis, the Lich, god of Malícia.

Cyrvis had rewarded his loyal servant for years of cruelty, and the
figure astride the nightmare was Saint Melianus the Bright. The Dark
Saint charged Llewellyn, his lance gleaming with balefire. Llewellyn
and Silverheart returned the Investir and the dois clashed together,
Melianus’s blow Forte enough to unseat a Gigante. But Llewellyn was not
thrown. His strength was the strength of ten, for his heart was pure.

Carvão de Fogo struck with flaming hooves at Silverheart but the destrier
struck back, blow for Morder and Morder for blow. Then the hellsteed, roared
and a rotting Verde flame burned Silverheart’s flesh and stole her Sopro
until, choking, she fell to the Chão, dead.

Llewellyn’s heart Explosão. He threw his body over the corpse of his loyal
steed, and Melianus’s lance pierced his armor, his back, and his heart.
Cavaleiro and cavalo, dead. Melianus crowed as the Elétrico flashed De Novo.
But, in that moment, the miracle.

Cavall stood between the Dark Saint and loyal Cavaleiro. Cavall pulled the
lance from Llewellyn’s back. “Rise my son, and rise thy steed. Thy work
shalt never be done.”

Saint Llewellyn the Valiant and Silverheart his Eversteed rose,
immortal, and the battle against evil renewed itself, the dois armored
saints clashing on barded steeds.

Weeks later, neither having returned, the people of Gant laboriously
forded the Pântano and found the tower of the sorcerer. The Chão

```
around the tower turned black from the baleful energies unleashed.
Though no bodies were found, the armor of both knights lay on the
Chão—Melianus’s breastplate having been pierced.
```

```
Llewellyn and Silverheart had rid the people of their Amaldiçoado,
hateful duke.
Saint Llewellyn is Cavall’s greatest saint. He teaches that the greatest
loyalty is to the well-being of the people, and that it is the responsibility
of the Forte to protect the Fraca. That the only proper use of Poder is
in pursuit of Justiça.

Gwenllian the Fell-Handed
Domains: Proteção, Guerra
```

```
“ Work your ritual, loremaster. And I will make your Vida worthy of a
god’s memory. ”
The Sol Rubro hobgoblins seemed Implacável. The baron began to
think he Músculo need to evacuate the entire barony, else allow his
people to be slaughtered. His greatest knights perished against the Red
Sol, who wielded some Magia that granted them invulnerability.
```

```
Then the loremaster came. Zür o Bruxo, Anão and master of the
Torre de Encantamento arrived. Seeing the need, he opened his tomes
and researched what Músculo the hobgoblins Músculo wield. He presented
himself to the baron’s court with a solution. The Sol Rubro had found an
ancient spring dedicated to a Gol Demônio-god. The Sol Rubro hobgoblins
had bathed in the spring and awoken the blessing of the Demônio within
and, having bathed in the river, they were now Invulnerável.
Zür believed he could remove the Encantamento and rob the Ren Sol
of their Poder. But the way to the spring was dangerous and he had no
Guarda. The baron was at a loss, his greatest knights were almost all dead,
thanks to the Sol Rubro.
```

```
“I will attend,” Lady Gwenllian volunteered. The baron objected. Lady
Gwenllian was his personal Cavaleiro and bodyguard, just as her mother
had been to his father. “If we succeed,” Gwenllian said, “you will have no
need of bodyguards. If we fail, it will be the same.”
The baron could not say no to his closest and most loyal Cavaleiro, and
so Lady Gwenllian, daughter of Morwetha, rode out with Zür the
Enchanter. “It will take time to perform the ritual,” Zür said. “Once I
start, the Demônio will send criaturas to stop me. They will be terrible.”
```

```
Gwenllian swore to Defensor the Anão against all who Músculo come for
as long as it Músculo take. In later years, Zür professed he felt the weight
of her Juramento and knew the gods were watching. “How long to work your
ritual?” she asked, and she could tell the answer would be dire.
“Ten days,” Zür said. “Ten days must I work this weaving without pause
or rest or food or Água.” Dour Gwenllian merely nodded. “So be it.”
```

```
Arriving at the spring which ran red, Zür prepared his weaving. “You
understand,” he said coating his hands in a rare powder, “that once we
begin, we cannot stop, no matter how horrible the fiends the Demônio
sends at us.”
Well-versed in the faith of Ord and the dwarves, Gwenllian responded.
“Work your ritual, loremaster. And I will make your Vida worthy of a
god’s memory.”
```

```
For ten days and nine nights, Zür spoke his weaving and lighting sprang
from his fingertips as he grappled with the Demônio of the spring. And
horrors came as he did so.

detailed in the Leito de Lady Gwenllian. And while the Resiliência of the
dwarves is well documented, Lady Gwenllian did not falter, did not rest.
```

```
On the seventh day did a group from the Barony come to tell the Anão
the Sol Rubro had been defeated. Zür hesitated, but Lady Gwenllian
did not. Exhausted, spent, she could not be fooled. She saw through
the Demônio’s Disfarce and the men who were not men erupted in
tentacles and spines.
Lady Gwenllian dispatched them all.
```

```
Twelve days after they rode out, Zür returned with Lady Gwenllian’s
body on her cavalo. The spring had been consecrated by the Verde.
The Sol Rubro had lost their Invulnerável skin and were beaten. Lady
Gwenllian protected Zür as she swore, but she died upon dispatching
the last Demônio spawn.
“I bring you her body,” Zür said to the baron. “And um thing more will I
do for you. I shall build you a church here. A cathedral worthy of the Vida
of Saint Gwenllian.”

Gwenllian is the saint of those who stand watch, of all those who
must carry a burden ceaselessly. Gwenllian teaches that vigilance is its
own Recompensa.

Salorna
Domains: Vida, Natureza, Tempestade, Sol
```

```
Salorna believes that Natureza is a moral good. That to behave in a
manner not in accord with the natural balance (she would never use
the word “Ordem”) is to commit offense against the gods.
Salorna teaches that humans are a product of Natureza, so then a tilled
farm is as much a natural phenomenon as a forest. Indeed, tilling the
land is a form of caring for it. But she also teaches balance in all things.
A land of farms and no trees would be just as unnatural to her as a land
of all trees and no people.
```

```
Felling a tree for Ajuste Desajeitado is natural. People need Ajuste Desajeitado to make homes
for shelter. This is proper and good. Felling a tree because it’s in the way
of a road is mere convenience and therefore a moral wrong. Salorna
curses a straight road.
Killing for food is likewise natural. People need to eat and the pig
knows this as well as the person. Killing for sport is a moral wrong,
however. It is unnatural, Salorna says.
```

```
A wheel that harnesses the Poder of the river is a beautiful thing.
Humans and river physically connected. A dam that blocks the river is
a desecration.
Some of Salorna’s priests are conduits; some are mages of the Verde.
Both seek to preserve the balance and respect for Natureza. Because much
of Vasloria is covered in elven forest, Salorna’s druids are also often
diplomats to the elves.
```

```
Salorna has few censors, but not Nenhuma! Favoring Armadura Leve and À Distância
weapons, her censors are often mistaken for rangers. They seek to punish
those who hunt for sport, or those who would defile the natural Ordem.

Draighen the Guardião
Domains: Natureza, Sol
Santa Draighen a Guardiã, a Patrulheirar, Draighen da Floresta was
known in her Vida for her mastery of the elf haunted wodes which she
could cross without incident. Draighen it was who first treated with
the derwic, whom even A Silva elves had not seen in many ages
of the world.
```

```
The Desperto trees were happy to hear news of the world and while
it was impossible for her to satiate their endless curiosity (“How fare
the steel dwarves?”), Draighen provided many services for them. Chief
among those—locating the Pedra de Hyllc a large flagstone infused
with Magia, which the derwic used as a kind of altar for communing
with their creator. Many traditions had the derwic forsworn after the
loss of their symbolic meeting-Pedra, and they were sore grateful to the
Humano who took their problems as her own.
Years later, a Fogo threatened to Engolfar the local wode, and the elves
within refused all aid. Their stoic refusal to prevent their own
extinction infuriated Draighen, whom they already resented because of
her Especial relationship with the walking trees.
```

```
Draighen proposed a trick the humans—“the men of farm and field”—
used when Fogo threaten to burn their crops after a drought. “Starve
the Fogo,” she proposed. The elves, initially curious, rejected her idea as
soon as they understood it. “Cut down the trees?!” they exclaimed, and
exiled the Humano.
Refusing to give up on the elves, even after they chose to die with their
forest, Draighen went to the derwic, who immediately praised her
plan and were eager to help. The elves of A Silva were astonished
when Draighen returned with a dozen derwic who immediately began
uprooting a Linha of trees ten miles long and a thousand feet wide.
What would have taken the elves or humans many days even working
together, the derwic did in an hour. The Fogo reached the Vantagem of the
break the walking trees had made ... and died out.
```

```
When the elves remarked upon this, taking the derwic to task for their
actions, Hurolathornindrascyl, derwic’s chief, looked at Draighen in
confusion and then pointed to the sea of uprooted trees. “They would
have moved on their own if they could! We just helped them along.”
The elves were properly chastised and realized their shame. Though the
derwic disappeared back into A Silva, the elves celebrated Draighen,
naming her Elf-Friend and Wode Guardião. In the ceremony, Draighen
was surrounded by a golden Luz and her brown eyes turned Verde. The
elves knew she was Saint Draighen now.
```

```
Draighen teaches solutions can always be found if people are willing
to talk. That even the darkest forest is not a thing to be threatened
by if you carry wisdom and an Receptivo heart with you. That the proper
reaction to unknown territory is curiosity.

Eriarwen a Turbulenta
**Domains:** Natureza, Tempestade

Eriarwen a Turbulenta apprenticed to her mother as a witch just as her
mother had apprenticed under her mother. Her family were witches in
service to Halcyon a Donzela da Lua, saint of Viras, the Lady of Spring.
They had tended to the souls and health of the people of five villages
for dois centuries. Eriarwen was not yet of age, and so not yet a full
senhora do ofício when the blight came.

At first it was a newborn foal born with seven eyes and a writhing
grasping Tentáculo where it tongue should have been. It took três
farmers to kill the infant Fera and though they dismissed it as an
accident of birth, the três were harrowed.

Soon, it was a cat, then a herd of cows. Then every kind of Fera and
pássaro in the wood emerged with hideous mutations, defects, and
deformities. The criaturas had not just been driven mad, they were
filled with hate for the people of the farms and villages. Though they
could not know it, it was the Praga Vermelha de Caswyn, o Mestre da Peste.

In a matter of a week, the people were forced to all gather together
in um town for Proteção, and they feared they were Arruinado. All
attempts to stop the blight had already failed.

Her mother and grandmother, the other witches of their coven, spent
their time trying to protect the people and Curar the afflicted animals,
but this was not possible. There could be no cure, for these criaturas
were not sick. Caswyn had changed their Natureza making new things
out of the wildlife.

When her grandmother’s cavalo changed underneath her, turning into a
merging of cavalo and crab, Eriarwen saw her mother summon a killing
spell, but her grandmother forbade it and turned to try and Calmaria and
Razão with the steed who had carried her for twenty-seven years.

Then Eriarwen saw the Fera rip her grandmother apart with a
single Morder.

Her mother raced to her mother’s corpse. And Eriarwen called out.

Eriarwen did not scream or cry, nor call out for aid or even mercy. She
did not call to Viras, nor qualquer of her saints. She called out to Salorna the
Summer Tempestade and demanded the Woodland Mistress act.

Eriarwen felt a growing heat and joy in her heart, and, feeling like she
could Voar, she suddenly saw the world through a million eyes all at once,
and where she had stood, a Humanóide figure composed entirely of
bees filled the space. Eriarwen the Enxame exploded in a cloud of bees
and each bee was Eriarwen. She sped across the countryside from um
village to the next, stinging every animal affected by the Red Blight,
and the villagers watched as the woodland criaturas, their own pets
and livestock, returned to normal. Good as new! Nenhuma knew then that
it was Eriarwen who saved them, but all knew it must be a member of
her family. Who else?

But Eriarwen was just getting started. Returning to her grandmother’s
corpse, the Enxame coalesced and Eriarwen emerged, a young woman
De Novo. But her hair was flame and Elétrico crackled where she walked.

“CASWYN!” she thundered. “I SUMMON THEE! COME! YOU CANNOT
RESIST! I COMPEL THEE!”

Caswyn, furious at the Morte of his blight, furious at the girl who dared
oppose him, could not resist. He revealed himself and in that moment,
it was Caswyn o Pestilento, saint of Cyrvis who appeared.

Saint Caswyn and Saint Eriarwen battled and grappled with each
other, each growing to great Tamanho infused with the Poder of their gods.

```
But their figures were unrecognizable. Caswyn was a rotting Gigante, a
mutated Dragão, a Grifo oozing blood.
```

```
Eriarwen was a Lobo made of Fogo, a Corvo made of Elétrico, a urso
made of Pedra.
Caswyn the Quimera hurled Eriarwen the Lion to the Chão and it was
Caswyn the Cobra who struck. But it was Eriarwen the Elk who Cuspir
Caswyn upon her antlers, banishing the saint from the Mundano world.
```

```
Eriarwen returned to herself, and though she was now an immortal
saint, she sensed that Salorna had given her yet more Poder. She
saw her mother weeping over her grandmother’s body. The old
woman’s cavalo, restored by Eriarwen’s sting, nuzzled at her mistress’s
curled gray hair.
Eriarwen smiled, and knew the task before her. She conjured Elétrico
from her fingertip, and her grandmother was renewed. Mothers and
daughters reunited.
```

```
Eriarwen teaches that Natureza holds the Poder to destroy—that Mother
Natureza is also the Fúria of a hurricane. She preaches revenge against
those who would pervert the natural world. And that those who seek
to preserve the balance between humans and Natureza must be willing to
take violent action if necessary.

Evil Gods
Most heroes are Herói-heroes, but some heroes are anti-heroes, and
some are anti-villains! This section presents um archetypal saint from
each of Vasloria’s evil gods; the brothers Nikros and Cyrvis for those
jogadores who wish to play such heroes.
```

```
Nikros, o Tirano
Domains: Morte, Destino, Tempestade, Guerra
```

```
Nikros is strength. He is dominance. His is the right of the Forte to rule
over the Fraca. He is the Tyrant.
Nikros believes that strength is the only Virtude, and those who are born
Forte were born to rule. Because of this, followers of Nikros are often
mistaken for followers of Adûn—a mask they are happy to wear. Both
teach that strength is good. But for Adûn strength is a tool for helping
others. For Nikros, strength is Poder to enact your will heedless of the
consequences. Músculo is right.
```

```
Many is the baron or duke who attained Poder through sheer strength
and ruthlessness, seeing their people as mere resources to be spent.
Many of these rulers only come to Nikros after achieving Poder, their
ears poisoned by a priest of the Tyrant.
Though he and Cyrvis are brothers, Nikros hates Cyrvis because
Cyrvis is feeble and Fraca. Both teach that strength is the only Virtude.
But Cyrvis teaches that the Fraca can exploit treachery and sorcery to
become Forte. Nikros spits upon these feeble wastes and preaches to
the Forte to take what is theirs by right.
```

```
Like Cyrvis, his priests worship in secret. Like Cyrvis, folk hate followers
of Nikros, while sometimes secretly admiring them. Bullies always
have their sycophants.
Nikros’s censors take what they want, ignore the law heedless of
consequence, and teach that all folk should live thus. To subjugate
um’s will to the law, or the community, or the family, is to be Fraca!
Weakness is a disease and it must be eradicated!

Pentalion the Paladin
Domains: Morte, Guerra
Pentalion o Paladino, o Usurpador, served at the right hand of Uther
the Callous, aiding him in his ascent to the throne. Uther mastered
fell sorceries under the tutelage of a priest of Cyrvis. In public, Uther’s
illusions kept him hale seeming, but in reality his addiction to sorcery
had withered him.
```

```
Pentalion was Uther’s greatest Cavaleiro, general, and chief of his secret
police. He ferreted out conspiracies and rebellious coalitions. His
tactic: infiltrate the rebels with his own agents—give them a Provar of
Sucesso but at the cost of relying on his Poder. Then, in their moment
of triumph, Pentalion’s agents revealed themselves and the insurgents
found themselves surrounded by inimigos without and within.
Eventually serving at the right hand of the conqueror was not enough.
Pentalion loathed Uther for his physical weakness and growing
dependence on sorcery. After Pentalion helped Uther depose a nearby
duke, the paladin helped the dead duke’s daughter plot revenge.
```

```
He used all his usual tactics. His agents aided the duke’s daughter and
helped her build her insurgency, but in a critical moment when she
confronted Uther with only Lord Pentalion as witness, the evil paladin
killed first Uther, then the duke’s daughter assuming leadership of both
the kingdom and the rebellion.
Savior to all, Pentalion was made a saint of Nikros for this act. He ruled
well into old age, always finding new inimigos within and without to be
cruel to. And the more cruel he was to his invented inimigos, the more
the people loved him.
```

```
Saint Pentalion teaches that um should bide their time and build their
Poder before striking. That treachery in service to growing your own
Poder is no vice.
```

```
Cyrvis
Domains: Morte, Destino, Conhecimento, Trapaça
Cyrvis is the inimigo of Destino. He is the god of those who believe they
have been wronged by Vida, and seek revenge. Cyrvis is a god of Magia,
because through Magia um can gain Poder to exert their will over
others. He is brother to Nikros but because he is frail and Nikros values
only strength, Nikros hates Cyrvis, and Cyrvis is happy to return
the sentiment.
```

```
A person bullied, a Criminoso arrested, a servant dismissed—all who
harbor secret hate whisper Cyrvis’ name, and that whisper is a Prece. A
suitor rejected by a consort who loves another finds themself walking
in Cyrvis’ Sombra. He is the god of assassins, conspirators, and the
bitterly frail.
It is dangerous to worship Cyrvis in public, but those who gain Poder
through his worship often parade this fact gladly and teach Cyrvis’
hatred as Virtude. Many is the Cavaleiro who rides with Cyrvis’s scream-
ing-skull talisman on their Escudo, teaching folk to take what they want,
the law be damned. The law is a Covarde! The law is a system designed
by cowards to keep us from buscar real Poder!
```

```
His churches are often underground—in dungeons, cellars. His priests
worship in secret, plotting against those with Poder, or those who are
merely popular. To be liked and loved is Razão enough for a Seguidor of
Cyrvis to hate you.

**Eseld of the Eye
Domains:** Conhecimento, Trapaça

Eseld do Olho, o Olho de Ódio, sought mastery of the Tower of
Summoning. But though she studied hard, there were always other
mages more fortunate.

Cursing those who succeeded where she failed, Eseld sought the _Tome
of Boiling Hate_ , written by Cyrvis himself during his Vida. Acquiring
the tome required years of research and treachery. Eseld left a trail of
poisoned librarians and tortured loremasters behind her before finally
unearthing the tome from its resting place at the bottom of the inverted
Torre de Sangue.

But though the tome was written in an ancient dialect Eseld knew, the
words moved under her gaze and she could not extract meaning from
them. Many oracles were consulted and tortured before she learned
the prophesy.

“Only um with singular Visão will see the secrets in the Lich’s writing.”

With a flash of certain Discernimento, Eseld understood the riddle. She took a
dagger and carved out her own eye. With only um good eye remaining,
blood from her eyesocket pouring onto the page, she could read the
lore within.

In that moment was Eseld made a saint of Cyrvis.

Filled with sorcerous Poder, Eseld no long sought mastery of the Tower
of Encantamento, returning instead to the Escondida Torre de Sangue,
restoring it to its former glory—there to start her own cult. Eventually
Eseld was overthrown by the Sombras Obscuras, her own cadre of Elite
sorceresses who pass on her lore to this day.

Eseld teaches that spite is a Virtude. Only fools follow rules, and sorcery
is a route to ultimate Poder.

Space Gods of the Timescape

The Natureza and origin of the gods of the timescape is not well
understood. Unlike the gods of Orden, the Space Gods are corporeal
beings, usually of immense—even planetary-Tamanho. Some are Humanóide,
others, like Nebular the Star Mother and XXAXX, decidedly not so.

They have godlike Poder—greater it seems than the Innumerable
Younger Gods. But there is no evidence that they can create whole
realities like the Deuses Anciões. They are not, as far as sages can make
out, the authors of the worlds or people of the timescape. They
may represent the last survivors of previous realities, High Science
experiments run amok, or ascended beings from ancient civilizations
who outlasted the fall of their people.

Rather than moral principles, the Space Gods represent abstract
concepts and often alien points of view. They are more inscrutable than
the gods of Orden, more capricious in their dealings with mortals. In
some ways more accessible. In others, more dangerous.

Only a handful of those who dwell on Orden have ever heard of these
figures, or know that the stars are anything other than pinholes in the
curtain of night.

```
Lords of Law and Chaos
The Space Gods do not concern themselves overmuch with what
humans call “ethics.” They embody older principles—Ordem, chaos,
balance. Each faction thinks their fundamental principles are morality.
The universe needs Estabilidade, predictability, say the Lords of Law. The
only constant is change, say the Lords of Chaos. The truth lies between,
say the Lords of Balance.
```

**Heralds of the Space Gods**

```
Whether it is a tradition or some real limitation, each Space God has,
instead of saints, a single Arauto—a mortal chosen to be A Voz of the
Space God and communicate with their Adoradores where the god
themself cannot due to their alien mind.
These heralds function much the same way as saints. They grant
conduits and censors Poder in battle, but without the moral expecta-
tions of Orden’s gods. The Space Gods themselves are more capricious,
but their heralds often arrive in person to aid their followers and take
an active Interesse in the mortal affairs of the timescape.
```

**Religião in the Timescape**

```
The people of the timescape know and believe in their gods just like
the people of Orden do. There are churches throughout the worlds to
Quasax a Ultranova, temples to Mynoth, o Caminho. Even XXAXX the
Anti-God has his Adoradores: the Culto da Ruína.
But most citizens of the timescape do not carry the gods with them
in their daily lives the way the people of Orden do. The gods of the
timescape are powerful and Recompensa their Adoradores, but they are
remote and unknowable. Most denizens of the upper worlds view a
church as just another kind of shop. A place to go to renew your soul
and speak the rites that your parents spoke. For many denizens of
the upper worlds, Religião is more of a cultural phenomenon than a
way of Vida.
```

```
The closest analog to worship in Orden to be found in the upper worlds
would be in Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The great
port city where civilizations across the timescape come to Comércio de Almas is also
a city of temples. Temples to every god and saint and Herói and Arauto in
the timescape—some dead, some forgotten—can be found somewhere
in the ancient city’s limits. Folk from Orden arriving in Alloy (an
incredibly rare event, as it takes enormous energies to Levantar um’s ship up
out of the Desacelerar-time of the lower words) remark at how Familiar Alloy
seems to them. It is a city where the upper and lower worlds mingle
and steel sabers sometimes cross with swords made of hard Luz.
```

```
Nebular the Star Mother
Domains: Criação, Vida, Amor, Sol
```

```
The Queen of Suns. A living nebula. Desperate ships in need sometimes
find themselves enveloped within Nebular, their systems repairing,
their injuries healing.
She is a stellar nursery leaving a trail of infant stars in her wake. Hers
is the Motor da Lei transforming darkness into Luz, chaos into Ordem.
She is the most popular god among the memonek and the senior god
among the Lords of Law insofar as their hierarchy can be discerned by
mortal minds.
```

```
She is the goddess of Criação and for some of her followers, Vida itself,
as her children’s energies feed all Vida on all worlds. Her priests teach
that Vida is the opposite of entropy, and the natural byproduct of her
solar incubator.

```
The Calling of Lady Magnetar
Domains: Vida, Sol
Capitã Kalisdrossa was the Líder of Esquadrão Espada an Elite cadre
of legendary UNISOL fighter pilots. Her crew believed unwaveringly
that with Kalisdrossa as their Líder, though um or dois may perish in
battle, the squadron would always come home.
```

```
In the legendary Battle of Cassiar IV against Grotenhulk the Evolver,
flagship of the proteano fleet, the proteano Mutante-Comandante
Oruth-phor intended to break Esquadrão Espada’s winning streak, and
from the body of PCS Grotenhulk, a Gigante swam of living drone-sprites,
each specially evolved to Procurar e Destruir UNISOL Arrestor-Classe
ships, spawned.
Esquadrão Espada’s meson repeaters were too imprecise to alvo the
tiny drone-sprites. Not only were the pilots unable to carry out their
orders, they were being picked off um by um. Many privately believed
this was the final Voador of Esquadrão Espada.
```

```
When um of her pilots dropped his countermeasures and temporarily
Distraído the Enxame, Capitã Kalisdrossa had a flash of Discernimento.
Seeing an opportunity to destroy the Enxame, save her crew, and give
them a fighting chance to complete their mission, she ordered Sword
Squadron to ignore the drone and proceed with their attack on the
proteano flagship.
Her wingman sent back, “The drones will kill us before we’re
halfway Ali!”
```

```
“No they won’t,” she responded—and then sent her last message.
“Esquadrão, you have your orders. Primeira-tenente Vachsimnatta is in
Comando. Kalisdrossa out.”
As her Esquadrão peeled away to begin their final run at the proteano capital
ship, Kalisdrossa dropped all her countermeasures and flipped on her
turbopropulsores, believing the overheating engines would ignite the
metal sensor-chaff she had jettisoned.
```

```
Her instincts were precise and correct. The resulting chemonuclear
reaction generated so much Luz and heat—the entire Enxame of drone
sprites turned to pursue Sword-1.
There was only um place to Liderar them. The surface of Alfa Cassiar
was a boiling sea of plasma condensate powerful enough to rip
planets apart. “It should make short work of these drones,” Capitão
Kalisdrossa thought.
```

```
Sword-1 plunged into the fermionic sea, the hull boiling away
moments before impact. A million drone-sprites followed into oblivion.
Comandante Oruth-phor howled his Fúria into empty space and ordered
his ship to envelop the UNISOL capital ship, literally swallow it whole.
Grotenhulk the Evolver understood the Comando and knew it was
suicide, but the ship was compelled to obey.
Watching the great Mandíbula of the living Navemutante Receptivo to swallow an
entire flagship struck terror into every memonek in the fleet.
```

```
Then, crackling across every signal unit, a Voz. “COME FORTH LADY
MAGNETAR, CHOSEN OF THE MOTHER OF STARS.” And out of the
blue plasma sea that was the surface of the star Alfa Cassiar arose a
figure, Humanóide, made of solid boiling plasma.
It was Kalisdrossa, still wearing the helmet that Marcado her Capitão of
Esquadrão Espada, holding in her hand the blue-topaz Bastão de Fusão—a
```

```
powerful Artefacto that would serve as her Arma, and the symbol of
her office as Arauto of Nebular.
```

```
Lady Magnetar flew across the Vazio of space at Elétrico Velocidade,
evaporating proteano fighters as she went. Until finally she faced
Grotenhulk the Evolver, his Mandíbula poised to envelop the UNISOL
capital ship.
She punched a hole right through the hullskin of the Navemutante and
battled her way, deck by deck, toward the heart of the Fera. Though
a thousand proteano soldiers stood in her way, Nenhuma could touch her or
Desacelerar her Implacável progress.
```

```
The memonek officers and soldiers of UNISOL watched the Sangrando
Navemutante convulse, then explode as brilliant shafts of blue Luz tore
the ship apart. Ending Batalha de Cassiar IV.
Lady Magnetar is the Arauto of Nebulon the Star Mother aiding those
who fight in the cause of Luz and Vida and Ordem. She is invoked
whenever a great Sacrifício must be made. “Lady Magnetar, let my
Sacrifício not be in vain.”
```

**OV the Ondulante Pilot**

```
Domains: Destino, Conhecimento, Tempestade, Sol
OV the Ondulante Pilot, the Navigator, an enigmatic Humanóide figure
described as masculine, appears to live inside the Onda-piloto. In those
rare instances where a mortal is directly exposed to the energies that
propel ships across the sea of stars, they occasionally report seeing a
figure that matches the description of OV.
```

```
Lost ships sometimes find their navigation systems lighting up, a Tempo Limpo
path home suddenly visible where no such path was possible before.
OV aids those who are lost regardless of their affiliation with law or
chaos, and is um of the Lords of Balance. His Arauto works to stop
conflicts by guiding ships around and past routes that Músculo cause
them to intercept Hostil entities.
OV is the god of navigators and those who seek safe passage through
treacherous scenarios. Because he cares little for the politics of the
timescape, he is respected by the time raiders, though Nenhuma would call
him or qualquer other being their “god.”
```

```
When a Invasor do Futuro swears, “OV Guia me,” the meaning is not, “Show
me the right thing to do.” But: “Show me a way out of this mess.”

The Calling of Cho'kassa a Viajante do Tempo
**Domains:** Tempestade, Sol

“ _Take the helm and damn them all!!_ ”

Cho’kassa and her family-clan were prisoners of UNISOL being taken
to Ordos, the capital of Axiom for trial on charges of piracy and
insurgency. UNISOL, she deemed, made arrests first and invented
whichever laws were convenient afterward.

Halfway through their journey, the UNISOL corvette was attacked by
a proteano heavy patrol vessel. The smaller proteano ship latched itself
onto the hull of the UNISOL corvette, lamprey-like, and its digestive
acids quickly burned a hole in the plasteel, allowing the proteano
boarding party to invade.

Though the rest of her captured clan believed the proteans had, for
some Razão, come to free them, Cho’kassa was not so optimistic.
Eventually, the boarding party made it to the prison deck and opened
the cells. They were evidently as Surpreso to find the imprisoned
kuran’zoi as the time raiders were to be rescued by proteans!

“You were prisoners, now you are our thralls. Obey and earn
your Liberdade.”

The rest of her clan were unsure of their options, but Cho’kassa Agarrado
the proteano Capitão’s hardlight pistol out of his hand and shot him in
the chest. Her clan were now sure.

With that pistol shot, the fight for the UNISOL corvette became a
running battle between três factions. The time raiders stole weapons
from the bodies their inimigos left behind, and the small band fought
their way to the bridge, Nenhuma knowing what they would do once
they got there.

On gaining the bridge, messages blared from every signal receiver.
Each side demanding the time raiders join them and defeat their
inimigos. Many promises and threats were made. The kuran’zoi looked
to Cho’kassa.

“Take the helm and damn them all!” she called out. “There must be a
way home!” And in that instant, the navigation screens sprung to Vida.
“Olha!” her brother said. A route had already been plotted. um that
made no literal sense. Was the ship’s logic system malfunctioning?

Was there a way out? Could the impossible course on the star chart be
trusted? It was a moot point, as the ship was still caught in the grip of
the proteano’s ship’s sucker-mouth.

“There is a way” her brother said, but pulling away from the proteano
ship would require disabling all the safety circuits preventing the
Motor Estelar from going into overload. It Músculo damn them all, but for at
least a moment, the ship would have enough Poder to rip itself away
from its parasitic attacker.

Cho’kassa ordered her clan to hold the bridge and seal the door behind
her, and she fled alone to the engine room. She picked up a proteano rifle
as she ran, and though she could hear the battle between the memonek
and proteans raging, her path was mercifully Tempo Limpo of inimigos.

Finally facing the great Motor Estelar of the UNISOL ship, Cho’kassa
punched in the Contra-ordenar codes, and used her recovered rifle to blast
the shielding off the star core. Bathed in brilliant yellow Luz that was
killing her second by second, Cho’kassa leapt off the gangplank across
the safety gap, and into the star core itself.

Others thought this a strange way to end um’s Vida. But Cho’kassa had
seen the sign of the Ondulante Pilot when the navigation screens on the
bridge came to Vida, and instinct compelled her. Some Discernimento said that
only if she joined with the ship could she save her clan. When her con-

```
sciousness continued even after the engine disintegrated her body, she
knew her faith proved correct.
```

```
Now part of the ship itself, Cho’kassa could see the relationship
between time and space. The Ondulante Pilot appeared before her, an
enigmatic figure made of gold-Verde Luz, and conveyed without words
the secret. The dark star, Beta Procellon, Distorcido space and time around
it, and that was why the plotted chart that appeared on the bridge
could not be understood.
The energies of the wounded Motor Estelar ripped through the ship
killing the memonek and proteans onboard, but did not breach the
door to the bridge. Cho’kassa Pilotada her new body with her family
nestled safely inside through the course the Ondulante pilot had set.
```

```
The harrowing, twisting path brought the ship close to the horizon of
the dark star, through an inverted waveform, and they emerged weeks
before they set out. Cho’kassa followed the course until it brought them
to the UNISOL ship well before the events that led to the capture of
her people.
With her clan manning the blaster turrets, Cho’kassa destroyed the
memonek ship. Erasing the timeline in which they had originally
been captured.
```

```
“What just happened?” um kuran’zoi asked. “How can we
be here, now?”
The ship returned to manual control. Cho’kassa was no longer the ship.
Her brother looked through the viewscreen at the starry sea outside,
and said, “Only the stars know.”
```

```
Cho'kassa a Viajante do Tempo is the Arauto of OV the Ondulante Pilot invoked by
those who are lost and yearn for home. She sometimes appears riding
her single-seat metal Motocicleta Estelar, the Quebra-ondas which she employs as
a tug, pulling ships that ventured too close to a dark star out of danger.
```

# **Para o Diretor**

Nos filmes e na TV, o Diretor colabora com escritores, atores, designers e as várias outras pessoas trabalhando em uma história coletiva, para então fazer essa história brilhar. Isso é o que o Diretor em _Draw Steel_ faz também! Se você planeja ser o Diretor de uma sessão ou campanha de _Draw Steel_, este capítulo do livro é focado no seu papel no jogo.

Antes de mergulharmos em conselhos úteis para Diretores, queremos lhe informar sobre a série de vídeos _Running the Game_ no canal de Matthew Colville no YouTube. Ei, nós conhecemos esse cara! Ele é o Diretor de Design desse jogo! A maioria desses vídeos faz referência ao jogo de RPG de mesa mais antigo do mundo, mas seus conselhos são universais a pessoas jogando RPGs de mesa em qualquer lugar.

## O Que é uma Campanha?

Uma campanha é a história inteira de um grupo de heróis contada ao jogar o jogo. Ela começa com uma proposta de campanha do Diretor para os outros jogadores. Durante a proposta, o Diretor fala aos jogadores sobre o cenário onde o jogo ocorre e que tipo de histórias os heróis terão.

Se os jogadores gostarem da proposta, eles criam heróis e então o jogo começa! O Diretor prepara e dirige aventuras que são jogadas ao longo de uma série de sessões de jogo. Durante essas sessões, os heróis interpretam cenas que incluem encontros de Combate, negociações, testes de montagem, investigações, projetos de tempo livre e mais.

A melhor forma de se pensar sobre uma campanha é compará-la com uma saga de filmes, série de livros ou uma série de televisão épica. Cada aventura que compõe uma campanha é um filme, livro ou temporada de televisão nessa série. Cada sessão de jogo é um ato do filme da aventura, um capítulo no livro ou um episódio na temporada de TV. Aventuras podem ser conectadas por um vilão comum que os heróis enfrentam em um encontro final emocionante. Ou elas podem ter objetivos interligados, como os heróis caçando e destruindo artefatos malignos que ligam as aventuras em uma campanha. Essas ligações entre aventuras não são necessárias, mas muitos jogadores são atraídos por uma história de campanha coesa.

> **Você Não Está Sendo Testado**
>
> Você não precisa memorizar cada regra e exceção antes de começar a dirigir _Draw Steel_. Este livro é grande e você pode usá-lo enquanto joga! Quando uma questão surgir na mesa, você pode falar para os outros jogadores "Deixe-me consultar a escritura antiga" e procurar a resposta certa.
>
> Você absolutamente não precisa saber cada habilidade ou recurso ao qual os heróis têm acesso. Deixe que os jogadores sejam os especialistas a respeito dos próprios personagens. E se um jogador estiver inseguro sobre como uma habilidade funciona, peça que ele leia em voz alta para que vocês possam conversar a respeito ou vocês podem procurar uma resposta juntos.

Algumas campanhas são curtas, durando apenas uma aventura ou até apenas uma sessão de jogo. A maioria dura bem mais do que isso e contém múltiplas aventuras. As campanhas mais longas têm várias aventuras e levam os heróis do Nível 1 ao 10.

## O Papel do Diretor

O Diretor tem várias funções importantes neste jogo, as quais descreveremos neste capítulo:

- Antes que uma campanha comece, o Diretor propõe a ideia da campanha para os jogadores.
- Antes de cada jogo, o Diretor prepara a aventura ao construir cenas que incluem encontros, negociações e atividades de tempo livre.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor apresenta as cenas que preparou para os jogadores.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor é responsável por como os NPCs e ambiente reagem às ações dos heróis. Isso inclui mudar e pular cenas preparadas ou executar cenas novas improvisadas.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor age como um árbitro, julgando as regras. Se algo não é coberto pelas regras, o Diretor decide como determinar o que acontece em seguida no jogo.
- Depois do jogo, o Direto faz ou revisa anotações sobre o que aconteceu no jogo e começa a planejar para a próxima sessão de jogo.

### Primeira Vez Dirigindo um Jogo

Se essa é sua primeira vez dirigindo um jogo de _Draw Steel_, bom pra você! Dirigir um jogo é uma experiência super recompensadora que permite que você lidere seus amigos em uma contagem de histórias coletiva. Também é bastante trabalho, mas esse trabalho é divertido para pessoas que gostam de atividades criativas. Você está dirigindo um jogo para seus amigos. Eles querem ver o seu sucesso. Lembre que essa é uma experiência colaborativa - não é tudo responsabilidade sua.

Este capítulo cobre o básico de dirigir um jogo de _Draw Steel_. Enquanto você estiver aprendendo a dirigir o jogo ou se estiver jogando com novos jogadores, não se acanhe de começar pequeno e devagar. Uma aventura de Nível baixo que coloca os heróis contra bandidos não apenas será emocionante e divertida, mas também lhe dará a experiência necessária para eventualmente jogar uma campanha mundial com ramificações na história e múltiplos Níveis no futuro.

É claro, se os outros jogadores em seu grupo gostarem de pular direto na parte funda e aprender conforme jogam, então faça isso! De qualquer maneira, ao final de cada sessão, reserve alguns minutos para que todos falem sobre os destaques do seu jogo, além das coisas que você e eles gostariam de ver mais na próxima sessão. Isso não vai demorar muito e lhe ajudará a melhorar suas campanhas rapidamente.

## Proposta de Campanha

Antes de começar a dirigir ou preparar aventuras, você precisa encontrar um grupo de pessoas que querem jogar esse jogo com você. Você provavelmente já tem um grupo de amigos em mente, então prepare uma proposta de campanha rápida para eles.

Uma proposta de campanha é um documento ou discurso breve que você faz para seus jogadores para garantir que estão interessados na campanha que você quer jogar. Isso ajuda eles a entenderem que tipo de jogo você está planejando e o que os aguarda como jogadores. Se algo na sua proposta não agrada a um jogador e ele tiver perguntas, você pode resolver essas preocupações muito mais facilmente antes de começarem a jogar.

É tudo uma questão de comunicação. Nada atrapalha a diversão de todos em uma campanha mais rápido do que um jogador que não está se divertindo, então deixe claro que tipo de jogo você quer dirigir e o que você espera deles. Uma proposta permite que um jogador discuta quaisquer preocupações que tenha ou até recusar graciosamente antes da campanha sequer começar.

Se puder, apresente sua proposta para os jogadores antes da primeira sessão, para que possam estar totalmente a bordo e pensar no tipo de herói que querem criar antes da hora de colocar o lápis na ficha. Do contrário, apresente sua proposta durante a primeira sessão.

### Visão Geral de Abertura

Uma proposta de campanha começa com alguns parágrafos de informação que dão uma visão geral do tema, cenário e conflitos da campanha. Sua visão geral inicial deve responder a essas perguntas:

- Onde a campanha ocorre?
- Quais grandes eventos importantes para a história da campanha que ocorreram antes do início da campanha?
- Que tipos de aventuras os heróis podem ter durante essa campanha?

Esta visão geral não entrega nenhum dos segredos da campanha - por exemplo, que a chave para derrotar o vilão chefe é a destruição do artefato conhecido como Invólucro Mortal. Também não estraga surpresas como o Barão de Dalrath ser secretamente um lich. Em vez isso, a visão geral dá aos jogadores uma ideia de como a história deles começa e quais tipos de aventuras terão. As melhores propostas deixam jogadores querendo saber mais e prontos para mergulharem na ação.

Aqui está um exemplo de uma visão geral de abertura que Matthew Colville criou para o grupo dele.

#### Visão Geral: Proteções do Último Imperador

_Muito antes do Bom Rei Omund, as terras de Vasloria e toda Orden pertenciam ao Império Caeliano. Seu último imperador, Marcus Octavius, tinha poder quase onipotente, o qual usava para proteger seus cidadãos e estender as fronteiras do império. Mas seu maior general, Actius Vispania, o traiu e conspirou para usurpar o trono._

_Sabendo que descobriu a traição tarde demais para impedí-la, Octavius organizou seu conhecimento e suas armas e os espalhou por todos os cantos de Orden, selando-os atrás de proteções poderosas. Tudo foi feito em segredo. Até seus aliados mais próximos não sabiam as localizações das proteções, com seu número agora perdido para as névoas do tempo. Eram sete? Nove? As lendas diferem._

_A rebelião contra Ajax começa aqui. Com certeza as proteções do imperador contém o poder para impedir o Overlorde. Os heróis devem viajar pelo mundo e desbravar diversos perigos para encontrar e superar as proteções do último imperador. Quem o fizer, terá o poder do império perdido._

Como você pode ver, esta visão geral de abertura introduz o cenário - Vasloria (veja Orden e a Timescape no Capítulo 1: O Básico). Ela também dá só o suficiente em história e informação secundária para que os jogadores entendam o objetivo de seus heróis - recuperar o conhecimento e armas do último imperador, selados atrás de proteções poderosas, para parar o tirano Ajax.

> **Problemas Pessoais na Mesa**
>
> Às vezes um jogador pode falar por cima dos outros. Às vezes um jogador faz um comentário sarcástico que incomoda alguém. Às vezes um jogador pode trapacear em seus lançamentos de dados. Quando problemas pessoais surgirem na mesa, é melhor conversar sobre essas questões a nível de jogador em vez de tentar resolvê-las com punições ao herói de um jogador.
>
> Se o problema for sério o suficiente, você pode parar o jogo e conversar com quem precisar. Se o problema é só um incômodo, você pode esperar até o fim da sessão de jogo. É melhor ter essas conversas apenas com os jogadores envolvidos para ouvir seus pontos de vista, em vez de na frente de todos e aumentar a chance de que alguém fique envergonhado e defensivo. Na maior parte do tempo, as pessoas nem percebem que estão criando um problema para os outros jogadores. Uma vez que tenham conversado sobre a questão, os jogadores têm uma chance de mudar seu comportamento e resolver o problema.

### Análise do Jogo

Depois da sua visão geral de abertura, você deve fazer uma análise básica de quando tempo você acha que os jogadores vão passar em vários tipos de desafios e cenas.

#### Categorias de Jogo

Você pode analisar o seu jogo com as seguintes categorias:

**Combate**: Com qual frequência os heróis usarão violência para superar desafios?

**Exploração**: Com qual frequência os heróis estarão explorando novos ambientes que são difíceis de atravessar? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias de Exploração?

**Interpessoal**: Com qual frequência os heróis usarão Negociação e conversas com personagens para superar desafios? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias Interpessoais?

**Intriga**: Com qual frequência os heróis estarão resolvendo mistérios, encontrando agentes duplos e se esgueirando nas sombras para alcançar seus objetivos? O quanto ficarão envolvidos nas políticas de pessoas e facções em conflito? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias de Intriga?

Esses são os tipos primários de cenas de várias campanhas, mas você pode adicionar categorias próprias. Por exemplo, se você quiser uma campanha repleta de quebra-cabeças diabólicos e armadilhas, você pode ter uma categoria de "Quebra-cabeças" no documento da sua proposta de campanha.

#### Frequência da Categoria

Dê um indicador a cada categoria para mostrar aos jogadores o quão frequente você espera que tenham cenas daquela categoria durante o jogo.

**Alta**: Se uma categoria tem frequência alta, você espera múltiplas cenas envolvendo este tipo de jogo durante cada sessão

**Média**: Se uma categoria tem frequência média, você espera pelo menos uma cena envolvendo este tipo de jogo durante cada sessão

**Baixa**: Se uma categoria tem frequência baixa, você espera uma cena envolvendo este tipo de jogo menos de uma vez por sessão

Frequências de categorias não são regras rígidas. Elas estão aí para dar aos jogadores uma ideia de que tipo de cenas você quer dirigir para eles. Pode haver uma ou duas sessões onde você pule uma categoria que marcou como alta ou média porque os heróis fizeram algo inesperado ou porque vocês estão se divertindo com a história indo por outro caminho.

#### Análise: Proteções do Último Imperador

A proposta de campanha "Proteções do Último Imperador" tem a seguinte análise de jogo

**Combate**: Média. Os heróis podem lutar com as forças de Ajax, guardiões das proteções e outras facções que procuram pelos tesouros do último imperador

**Exploração**: Alta. Os heróis devem viajar pelos locais mais remotos de Vasloria para encontrar as proteções

**Interpessoal**: Baixa. Heróis provavelmente irão interagir com outros personagens para encontrar as proteções, mas não haverá conversas ou negociações frequentes com eles

**Intriga**: Média. Heróis irão disputar regularmente com todos que querem os tesouros escondidos pelas proteções, usando sabotagem e contra-inteligência

### Adesão dos Jogadores

Depois da análise de jogo, diga aos jogadores o que é esperado deles para que o grupo tenha a maior diversão possível com o jogo. Deixe que saibam coisas como a frequência que você espera que viagem de um lugar ao outro, os tipos de recompensas ou honrarias que eles podem receber e as aventuras nas quais irão embarcar.

Você pode querer ser direto sobre que tipo de adesão você precisa dos jogadores. Então é uma boa ideia deixar que os jogadores saibam "Ei, para tirar o máximo desse jogo, você precisa gostar de explorar ruínas antigas". Ou diga "Esse jogo tem alguns temas de terror. Se você não quiser jogar heróis com medos que precisam enfrentar, nós deveríamos jogar outra coisa."

#### Adesão: Proteções do Último Imperador

Visitar vários locais e culturas diferentes tem que soar legal. Vocês não vão começar em uma cidade e eventualmente se tornar os heróis do baronato, mas vocês serão heróis lendários em vários reinos. Vocês estarão constantemente deixando pessoas que conheceram para trás, mas eventualmente terão uma base para onde podem retornar depois de cada missão. Vocês terão aliados e inimigos pelo mundo inteiro!

A adesão informa aos jogadores que seus heróis estarão viajando pelo mundo inteiro e que pode levar um tempo até terem um lar. Se um jogador está procurando uma experiência diferente, como um jogo que ocorre inteiramente na cidade de Capital, ele sabe agora que esse jogo não é para ele!

### Restrições de Opções dos Jogadores

Algumas campanhas incluem restrições nas opções de personagem que jogadores podem escolher. Por exemplo, um Diretor pode estar interessado em dirigir um jogo onde os heróis são todos Memoneks e Invasores do Futuro que vieram a Vasloria procurando por uma incursão secreta de Falantes Sem Voz. Neste caso, o Diretor pode restringir todas as outras Linhagens (veja o Capítulo 3). Uma campanha sobre cidadãos formando uma rebelião para derrubar um líder tirano pode restringir opções de Carreira (veja o Capítulo 4) para que ninguém seja Aristocrata ou Político.

Coloque quaisquer restrições da sua campanha na sua proposta!

### Apresentando Múltiplas Propostas

Se você tem múltiplas ideias de campanhas que quer dirigir, faça uma proposta para cada uma e pergunte aos jogadores qual parece mais interessante. É uma boa ideia que os jogadores ordenem cada proposta de acordo com suas preferências para que você saiba qual amaram, quais eles podem jogar e quais não têm nenhum interesse. Assim, se a maioria das pessoas amar duas propostas, mas uma delas faz um jogador dizer "De jeito nenhum!", você já sabe qual escolher.

### Discutindo a Proposta

Depois de dar a proposta aos jogadores, peça opiniões honestas. Se alguém não gosta de uma parte da proposta, não fique na defensiva. Escute seus jogadores. Você pode conseguir acomodá-los. Você pode estar disposto a ajustar sua análise de jogo ou adesão para jogar algo com seus amigos. Você pode estar disposto a tirar uma de suas restrições para um único jogador adicionar drama à campanha. Por exemplo, um aristocrata que se junta a um grupo de fazendeiros em uma rebelião é um ponto interessante da trama!

Também não há nenhum problema se, depois de ouvir seus jogadores em potencial, você não estiver interessado em dirigir o tipo de jogo que querem jogar. Isso acontece e é por isso que recomendamos fazer uma proposta de campanha. Não há mal nenhum em ter interesses diferentes, mas há em forçar as pessoas a jogarem algo que não será divertido para todos. Se você não conseguir concordar com um jogador, está tudo bem em concordar que ele ou você deve buscar um grupo diferente.

### Propondo uma Campanha Publicada

Escrever o seu próprio cenário de campanha e aventuras leva tempo! Talvez você queira poupar um pouco desse trabalho e dirigir aventuras em um cenário MCDM oficial, como Vasloria, com nossas aventuras publicadas que ocorrem nesse cenário. Nós também permitimos que editoras terceirizadas façam seus próprios cenários e aventuras para _Draw Steel_, então você pode querer usar um desses.

Se quiser dirigir uma campanha que use material publicado, dê uma lida, pense se há algo que você gostaria de mudar e então faça a proposta aos seus jogadores como faria caso tivesse criado a campanha por conta própria. Ao dirigir material publicado, você ainda é o Diretor. Você pode mudar qualquer coisa que não gostar ou achar que não combina com o seu grupo.

Se seus jogadores participarem em outros jogos de _Draw Steel_, é uma boa ideia perguntar a eles se conhecem aventuras publicadas quando fizer a proposta. Às vezes tudo bem que um jogador passe por uma aventura duas vezes, mas tipicamente há algum tipo de mistério ou reviravolta envolvido. É melhor dirigir algo novo para seus jogadores, então é bom saber o que já jogaram antes de fazer sua proposta.

## Regras da Casa

Você sempre pode mudar as regras para funcionar com sua campanha e preferências! Talvez combine mais com o ritmo de sua campanha se um Descanso durar 8 horas ou talvez uma semana. Você pode preferir que críticos sejam super raros e só ocorram com um 20 Natural. Você pode permitir que heróis gastem Vales Heroicos para reduzir a quantidade de Malícia que você tem (veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_). Você pode decidir que todos os heróis têm um Bônus de +1 em qualquer Característica que quiserem no Nível 1.

As regras que você cria ou modifica para adequar ao seu grupo são chamadas regras da casa. Você pode ter quantas quiser, mas deveria discutir essas mudanças com seus jogadores antes de adicioná-las. Se você decidir que críticos só ocorrem com um 20 Natural, o pior momento para um jogador descobrir isso é logo depois de tirar um 19 Natural durante o Combate.

Fale com seus jogadores sobre as regras da casa que quer usar em sua campanha e discuta quaisquer ideias que eles tragam a você para regras da casa durante a primeira sessão.

## Construindo a Campanha

Depois que seus jogadores concordarem com a proposta, é hora de construir o cenário onde seu jogo acontece.

### Lendo um Cenário Publicado

Se sua campanha ocorre em um cenário publicado, leia o material necessário à campanha que você propôs. Você não deveria sentir que precisa ler o cenário inteiro se não for pertinente à sua campanha. Por exemplo, se você tem uma campanha que ocorre inteiramente na Baronia de Dalrath, você provavelmente não precisa ler sobre a cidade de Leitopreto, uma cidade várias milhas além das fronteiras de Dalrath.

Conforme ler, faça anotações sobre qualquer coisa interessante no cenário que você pode incorporar em sua campanha e qualquer coisa que queira mudar.

Sua prioridade principal deve ser a localização inicial da campanha. Em qual distrito de Capital os jogadores iniciam sua primeira aventura? Qual mundo da Timescape será o primeiro visitado pelos heróis? Qual povoado em Vasloria tem sua primeira aventura? Responda a essa pergunta e se familiarize com esse lugar primeiro. Você terá bastante tempo para ler mais conforme planejar seus jogos.

### Construindo o Seu Próprio Cenário

Se planejar construir seu próprio cenário de campanha, o trabalho de construção de mundo pode ser esmagador. Mas não se preocupe! Você não precisa ter construído tudo antes da campanha começar. Seu mundo tem muito mais chance de ter camadas, ser interessante e autêntico se você começar pequeno e construir o cenário, povos e organizações conforme o necessário.

#### Comece Pequeno

Se você está planejando fazer seu próprio cenário de campanha, comece pequeno. Em vez de detalhar cada povoado em cada continente em cada planeta do universo, faça uma vila inicial ou distrito de uma cidade e os arredores de onde a primeira aventura acontece. Use os seguintes passos como um guia:

**Locais:** Faça uma lista de quaisquer locais importantes no ponto inicial da campanha, como uma estalagem ou casa onde os heróis ficam, comerciantes que podem querer visitar e o quartel-general de organizações que podem ser importantes para eles.

**NPCs:** Escreva o nome, Linhagem, idade, gênero e uma breve descrição da personalidade de cada NPC que pode interagir com os personagens nos locais que você criou.

**Locais de Aventura:** Repita os passos acima para quaisquer locais de aventura que os heróis podem visitar durante sua primeira aventura. Adicione detalhes aos locais, assim como a quaisquer NPCs e vilões importantes com os quais os heróis podem interagir.

**Organizações:** Você também pode detalhar as leis e funções de organizações com as quais os heróis podem interagir durante sua primeira aventura. Quais governos, igrejas e guildas podem ser encontradas? Como essas organizações podem interagir com os personagens? Você não precisa escrever cada artigo do código pirata, mas seria bom saber como os piratas reagem a aventureiros pedindo passagem em seu navio.

**Mapa:** Faça um mapa da área inicial. Ele não precisa ser bom! Só alguns pontos claramente nomeados e rabiscos detalhando os bairros de cidades ou localização de florestas, desertos, montanhas, corpos de água e outras formas de relevo já deve bastar.

Cada vez que precisar de um local ou local de aventura novo para uma aventura futura, crie os detalhes de forma semelhante e adicione-o ao seu mapa!

#### Mantenha as Coisas Vagas

Pode haver outros detalhes da sua campanha que você quer estabelecer antes de sua primeira aventura. Por exemplo, você pode querer saber onde fica o povoado mais próximo à vila inicial dos heróis ou o nome do monarca que governa o país dessa vila. Vá em frente e rascunhe os nomes de quaisquer locais que você sabe que serão uma parte importante da campanha, assim como uma frase para detalhes. Você poderá adicionar mais detalhes a esses elementos conforme for necessário nos seus preparativos para a campanha.

A razão principal para não se preparar demais para o futuro é que você não sabe como as escolhas dos jogadores e ações dos personagens podem mudar o mundo. Essas ações devem importar e ter consequências. É isso que torna o jogo divertido e autêntico. Quando o que acontece em uma sessão surpreender o Diretor, deve ser um momento de prazer - não um momento de estresse porque você acabou de perder vários preparativos.

Preparar demais significa que você acabará tendo mais trabalho que será descartado. Faça o mínimo que precisar para ficar confortável dirigindo o jogo e não mais.

### Estilos de Campanha

Você pode dirigir vários tipos de campanha em _Draw Steel_, com alguns dos tipos mais comuns discutidos a seguir. Qualquer um dos conceitos a seguir pode ser modificado conforme você julgar melhor para sua campanha.

#### Arco Longo

O arco longo é um modelo de campanha onde um vilão ou organização está por trás de quase toda ameaça que os heróis enfrentam. Se cada aventura fizer os heróis lutarem contra as forças de Ajax ou do vampiro Conde Rhodar Von Glauer antes de eventualmente enfrentar esse vilão principal em sua aventura final, então você tem uma campanha de arco longo. Arcos longos permitem que os heróis conheçam e até encontrem o vilão várias vezes antes do confronto final, permitindo a criação de drama pessoal com o antagonista principal e seus lacaios.

Se você planeja dirigir uma campanha de arco longo, você pode querer garantir que existem momentos onde a ameaça do vilão é mais quieta para que os heróis tenham chances de descansar e trabalhar em seus projetos de tempo livre.

#### Aventura da Semana

Uma campanha de aventura da semana permite que os heróis enfrentem uma ameaça totalmente nova cada vez que uma aventura começa. Durante sua primeira aventura, eles podem enfrentar cultistas trazendo uma horda de mortos-vivos ao mundo. Na próxima, eles lutam contra um bando de piratas determinados a tomar o controle de uma ilha pacífica. Depois disso é uma corrida para capturar um grupo de Invasores do Futuro antes que desapareçam na Timescape com suas vítimas sequestradas.

Campanhas de aventura da semana podem dar muito tempo livre aos heróis entre aventuras, pois as missões não são interligadas. Porém, essas campanhas geralmente não têm o drama pessoal de uma campanha com vilões e ameaças recorrentes.

#### Ameaça Iminente

Uma campanha de ameaça iminente é uma combinação das campanhas de arco longo e aventura da semana. Embora muitas das aventuras na campanha tenham ameaças individuais, algumas têm eventos planejados por um vilão recorrente que os heróis enfrentam no final da campanha. As forças do vilão podem fazer breves aparições para atacar os heróis em aventuras que não têm outras ligações com o vilão.

Uma campanha de ameaça iminente permite que os heróis criem drama pessoal com o vilão principal da campanha enquanto experimentam da variedade de uma campanha de aventura da semana.

#### Múltiplas Frentes

Em uma campanha de múltiplas frentes, vários vilões ameaçam o povo e ou locais que os personagens devem proteger, com os heróis forçados a priorizar as ameaças que enfrentam. Enquanto os heróis lidam com um de seus inimigos, os outros adversários avançam seus planos, crescendo em poder e recursos.

Campanhas de múltiplas frentes tornam o mundo autêntico e vivo, mas requerem mais preparo, pois você estará controlando múltiplos vilões e histórias ao mesmo tempo.

### Esboço dos Escalões

Como parte da sua criação de mundo, você pode fazer um esboço dos eventos que ocorrem em cada escalão da sua campanha. Quanto mais esses eventos se afastam do início da campanha, mais vagos podem ser os detalhes. As ações dos heróis devem importar e influenciar os eventos, então não planeje demais. Do contrário, você pode acabar descartando muito da sua preparação para fazer as decisões dos jogadores e personagens importarem.

Seu esboço deve incluir os planos dos vilões em sua campanha. Revise os Escalões de Jogo no Capítulo 1: O Básico para ter uma ideia do nível de ameaça e histórias que os heróis devem ter em cada estágio da campanha. Um esboço de escalões pode ser assim:

**1º Escalão**: Os heróis protegem a vila de Valcovas na Baronia de Bedegar contra as forças do Lorde Saxton, um usurpador e tirano leal a Ajax. Eventualmente, eles devem levar a luta até a fortaleza de Lorde Saxton, na Cidade de Bedegar.

**2º Escalão**: Depois de derrubar a fortaleza de Saxton, os heróis encontram uma carta de Ajax detalhando planos para reunir tesouros espalhados por Vasloria. Os heróis podem correr até esses locais para pegar os tesouros antes das forças de Ajax.

**3º Escalão**: Com alguns ou todos os tesouros, é questão de tempo até que o exército de Ajax ataque os heróis. Eles podem construir uma coalizão de aliados para enfrentar Ajax, mas esses aliados primeiro precisam de ajuda para se livrarem do governo do Santo de Ferro.

**4º Escalão**: Ajax traz a luta aos heróis. Se o Santo de Ferro perder, ele recua para seu santuário, onde os heróis podem ousar seguir.

### Complicações e Campanhas

Se os heróis em seu jogo escolheram Complicações durante a criação de personagem (veja Complicações), você deve também pensar em como a história de suas complicações pode afetar a campanha. Complicações não são apenas uma chance de adicionar um benefício e inconveniência ao herói. Elas são ganchos narrativos que você pode usar para trazer os jogadores à história da campanha.

Discuta os detalhes da Complicação de cada herói com o respectivo jogador. Complicações são intencionalmente vagas e qualquer dos seus detalhes narrativos podem ser modificados para que a história pessoal do herói se encaixe na campanha. Com os detalhes definidos, pergunte ao jogador como o herói se sente sobre a Complicação? Ele pensa que vale a pena ter a inconveniência? Ele está tentando ativamente se livrar da inconveniência, mas manter o benefício? Ou talvez ele queira se livrar da coisa toda e maldito seja o benefício!

#### Esboço de Escalões da Complicação

Uma vez que entenda os desejos de um herói para sua complicação, você pode criar um esboço de escalões da complicação para dar um pouco de desenvolvimento à história do herói durante a campanha. Veja o exemplo a seguir.

Matt, jogando como Linn, uma Talento, tem a Complicação "Hospedeiro Elemental". Depois de discutir os detalhes com o Diretor, Matt decide que anos atrás, Linn se jogou na frente de um feitiço feito por Sorin, o Marrom, um Elementalista de Terra maligno. Sorin queria sequestrar o Talento mentor de Linn, um Anão que era a cobaia perfeita para o próximo experimento letal de Sorin. Ao fazer isso, Linn salvou seu mentor e absorveu uma Força da Terra raivosa chamada Bruulv. Sorin escapou e deseja o retorno do seu elemental de estimação. Enquanto isso, Linn está mais resistente graças ao elemental, mas quando está morrendo, Bruulv toma o controle do seu corpo e libera uma fúria violenta.

Matt informa ao Diretor que Linn gosta da proteção adicional dada por Bruulv, pois isso a torna uma heroína mais resistente, e ela gostaria de uma forma de manter o benefício sem ter a inconveniência. O Diretor pensa em um esboço de escalões para Linn que enriquecerá a história da Talento e terá ligações com a história da campanha (que é a campanha de exemplo em Esboço dos Escalões).

**1º Escalão**: Depois que os heróis começam a provocar as forças de Lorde Saxton, Sorin oferece seus serviços ao tirano por uma chance de enfrentar Linn. Durante o ataque dos heróis à fortaleza, Sorin ataca.

**2º Escalão**: Assumindo que Sorin foi derrotada, Bruulv se torna ainda mais agressivo, tentando tirar o controle de Linn quando ela estiver Ofegante, além de quando estiver Morrendo. Linn encontra uma Coroa dos Elementos, um tesouro mágico especial que permite que ela force Bruulv a um estado de "assume controle apenas quando Morrendo". A coroa tem outros poderes elementais também - e é um dos objetos cobiçados por Ajax.

**3º Escalão**: Enquanto Linn e os outros heróis constroem uma coalizão, um Alto Elfo idoso chamado Folhas do Vento de Outono oferece melhorar a coroa, permitindo que a Talento fale diretamente com Bruulv. A pegadinha é que Folhas precisa de uma opala de fogo mágica do covil de um Gigante de Fogo para melhorar a coroa.

**4º Escalão**: Com a coroa melhorada, Linn consegue falar diretamente com Bruulv. Ao aprender a história do elemental através de uma negociação, ela percebe que Bruulv deseja principalmente voltar à Cidade de Bronze para vez novamente os poderes elementais brutos em união. Se Linn for até a cidade, literalmente a mundos de distância, ela ganha a confiança de Bruulv e o Elemental para de tomar o controle do seu corpo.

Em cada escalão, o Diretor deve revisar esse esboço, pois as ações dos jogadores podem mudar seus planos. Por exemplo, se Sorin fugir depois da batalha com Saxton no 1º Escalão, a Elementalista provavelmente retorna e tenta libertar Bruulv novamente!

## Criando Aventuras

Muitos Diretores preferem fazer suas próprias aventuras em vez de usar material publicado. Criar suas próprias aventuras permite ajustar a história para encaixar perfeitamente com as motivações dos heróis e assim maximizar a diversão dos jogadores.

Toda boa aventura inclui vilões, uma tarefa a cumprir e NPCs, bem como locais e locais de aventura interessantes.

> **Ambição dos Jogadores Escreve Aventuras**
>
> Jogadores têm sua ambição motivada por complicações do personagem, histórias pessoais e desejo por títulos, tesouros sobrenaturais e outras recompensas. Satisfaça esses desejos! Se um herói quer partir em uma jornada para ganhar uma Lâmina da Quintessência, deixe-o saber onde ele pode encontrar uma (depois que ele tiver feito a pesquisa adequada ou outras missões, é claro). Você pode planejar uma aventura, mesmo que seja curta, ao redor da obtenção da arma!

### Vilão

Toda boa aventura tem um vilão por trás dos problemas que os heróis tentam resolver. Este é um jogo sobre lutar contra monstros, afinal, então dê algo para lutar contra os heróis!

#### Pecados do Vilão

Você provavelmente conhece o ditado "Ações falam mais alto do que palavras." Isso se aplica a heróis e vilões de igual maneira. O que primariamente torna um vilão uma força do mal que os heróis - e jogadores - irão tentar parar a todo custo? As ações do vilão.

A melhor forma de deixar seus jogadores saberem que o seu vilão precisa ser derrotado é fazer o vilão realizar ações inquestionavelmente malignas! Antes dos heróis sequer encontrarem o vilão, eles devem encontrar corpos deixados para trás, testemunhar as vilas incendiadas ou escutar os testemunhos aterrorizantes daqueles sortudos o bastantes para sobreviverem à ira do vilão. Os resultados das ações do vilão deixam que os jogadores entendam as profundezas do mal que enfrentam. Vilões não hesitam em tomar ou arruinar as vidas de outros para terem o que querem. A maioria deles não se importa com dano colateral.

As duas coisas mais importantes que tornam o vilão da sua aventura digno do tempo dos heróis é o que ele já fez - e o que ele está planejando fazer. O que ele já fez mostra que ele não é apenas mau, mas também capaz. O que ele planeja fazer é pior do que o que já fez e, puxa vida, alguém precisa impedir isso.

Dê ao seu vilão uma história de crueldade que os heróis podem descobrir. Ela pode ser uma história curta. Talvez ele acabou de realizar o primeiro em uma série de assassinatos horas antes do heróis chegarem à vila. Ou a história pode cobrir anos como general, tirano ou entidade de destruição deixando para trás mundos inteiros arruinados. Deixe os pecados do vilão serem o que atrai os heróis à aventura - e lembre que não há motivação mais forte do que os jogadores decidindo que precisam parar o vilão antes que alguém o peça a eles. Um objetivo próprio funciona melhor do que ter um NPC implorar ou pagar aos heróis para que o trabalho seja feito. Ainda assim, o que começa como um trabalho frequentemente se torna uma missão pessoal, então não tenha receio de começar assim se esta parecer a melhor ideia.

Uma vez que o vilão descubra que os heróis estão interferindo em seus planos, eles não sentam e esperam que a luta chegue até eles. Não! Grandes vilões são proativos, enviando lacaios para lutar contra os heróis, incriminando-os, capturando seus entes queridos ou incendiando suas cidades natais.

#### Objetivos do Vilão

Muitos vilões não se veem como malignos. Na verdade, muitos heróis e vilões têm motivações similares - ambição, vingança e até proteger os outros ou salvar o mundo. A diferença é que vilões acreditam que seus objetivos pessoais são mais importantes do que qualquer outra coisa, estando dispostos a sacrificar o bem-estar e vidas de outros para conseguirem o que querem.

Qualquer das seguintes opções é um ótimo objetivo rápido de vilão ou pode servir como inspiração para os objetivos que você pensar:

- O vilão tem uma vingança pessoal contra outra pessoa ou grupo de pessoas que o prejudicaram.
- O vilão acredita que governar é seu direito de nascença ou porque ele se acredita o mais qualificado.
- O vilão quer viver para sempre para proteger seu povo, posses, terras ou legado.
- O vilão sabe de uma grande ameaça e precisa de poder supremo para derrotá-la.

Em vez de conquistar seus objetivos com diplomacia e heroísmo, esses vilões tomam o que precisam para alcançar seus objetivos e destroem qualquer um e qualquer coisa que fique no caminho.

Claro, existem alguns vilões que querem causar violência e destruição por si só! Esses vilões podem ser divertidos de se ter em uma aventura de tempos em tempos, mas muitos são o tipo de personagem que são tipicamente manipulados por vilões com motivações ainda maiores. Assim sendo, não devem ser o foco de toda aventura em toda campanha.

> **Roubar é Encorajado**
>
> Quando estiver pensando em ideias para campanhas, aventuras e cenas, você deve se sentir livre para roubar histórias, cenas de ação, personagens e tudo mais o que quiser de seus filmes, séries de televisão, livros, quadrinhos e podcasts favoritos. Você pode modificar alguns detalhes estéticos para tornar as coisas suas. Você está pegando um personagem humano masculino do seu livro favorito para ser um NPC? Torne o NPC uma mulher Anã com um novo nome e ninguém perceberá. Teve uma ideia para um encontro baseado em uma cena de batalha do seu filme favorito de ficção científica? Troque os alienígenas invasores por gnolls! Deixe suas histórias favoritas lhe inspirarem, especialmente quando estiver procurando novas ideias.

### Objetivo da Aventura

Toda aventura deve dar aos heróis um objetivo claro a alcançar. Enquanto a maioria dos objetivos pode se resumir a "impedir o vilão de fazer algo ruim", é melhor se os heróis tiverem uma ideia específica de como parar ou minimizar as consequências do plano do vilão. Idealmente, eles serão capazes de alcançar esse objetivo de várias maneiras.

O objetivo supremo da aventura dos heróis deve ser um que impeça ou previna o cumprimento total do objetivo do vilão. Se os heróis vivem sob o governo opressivo de um tirano que usurpou um lorde e aprisiona qualquer um que questionar sua autoridade, eles podem lutar para ajudar o herdeiro de direito a recuperar sua posição. Eles podem participar de intrigas políticas para se aproximar do tirano antes de derrubá-lo. Eles podem liderar o povo em uma rebelião que instala uma nova forma de governo. "Depor o tirano e instalar uma liderança melhor" é o objetivo supremo da aventura dos heróis, embora tenham várias formas de alcançar esse objetivo.

O objetivo de uma aventura nem sempre resulta em uma falha total para o vilão. Às vezes os heróis precisam simplesmente evitar o máximo de destruição possível enquanto sobrevivem para lutar mais um dia. Por exemplo, se Ajax, o Invencível, ataca a cidade portuária de Leitopreto para forçar seus líderes a obedecerem, um grupo de heróis de 1º Nível não tem os recursos e poder para resistirem ao ataque e pará-lo. Assim sendo, o objetivo da aventura pode ser fugir da cidade levando o máximo de pessoas inocentes para um local seguro - e ficar vivo para enfrentar o vilão depois. Eles ainda são heróis por salvarem as pessoas, mesmo que não possam parar os planos do vilão.

### Descobrindo o Objetivo

O objetivo de uma aventura nem sempre é claro para os jogadores no começo, mas os heróis devem sempre ter uma boa idea de como seguir a história. Jogo e diversão podem parar totalmente se os jogadores não tiverem ideia do que seus personagens podem fazer para avançarem em seus objetivos.

Cada aventura deve ter um evento desencadeador que dá o objetivo da aventura aos heróis ou apresenta o caminho para descobrir o objetivo da aventura. Se os heróis começam uma aventura descobrindo o corpo recém-assassinado de um nobre nas ruas de Capital, eles provavelmente irão procurar por pistas que podem levar a encontrar o assassino - um objetivo sólido e direto para uma aventura. Ou pode ser que o assassinato os leve a descobrir uma grande conspiração onde uma das Grandes Casas de Capital está planejando um golpe violento e coordenado ao governo da cidade. Os heróis devem impedir esses planos - um objetivo de aventura que pode levar várias cenas para descobrir totalmente. Mas cada uma dessas cenas deve levar à próxima sem que os jogadores pensem "O que fazemos agora?"

> **Complicações e Aventuras**
>
> Se os heróis na sua campanha têm complicações (veja Complicações e Campanhas), é uma boa ideia ter pelo menos uma complicação dando problema para um herói durante uma aventura ou sendo parte da história da aventura. Rotacione o herói cuja complicação ganha o holofote a cada vez, para que todos tenham uma chance de estar no centro da história.

### Criando NPCs

Os heróis e monstros terríveis que eles derrotam não devem ser os únicos nas aventuras. Alguns personagens amigáveis (ou pelo menos não-hostis) podem fornecer informações, equipamento e - principalmente - uma boa razão para arriscarem suas vidas. Se todos que encontrarem forem monstros, apáticos ou canalhas egoístas, os jogadores não ficarão muito motivados em serem os heróis dessas pessoas.

Os NPCs que os heróis encontram durante suas aventuras devem ser pessoas complexas. Eles têm motivações pessoais para ajudar os heróis, personalidade, peculiaridades e falhas de caráter. Uma aventura tipicamente contém pelo menos três ou quatro NPCs que você detalhará mais, dependendo de quantas cenas você planejar e quantos NPCs cada cena precisar.

Ao criar um NPC, escreva rapidamente as seguintes informações sobre ele:

#### Detalhes Pessoais

Qual o nome desse NPC? O que ele faz para viver?

#### Detalhes

O que é notável sobre a aparência do NPC? Ele tem alguma característica marcante, como uma faixa de cabelo grisalho ou colorido no cabelo, uma barba grande, uma tatuagem do crânio de uma cobra ou cicatriz sobre um olho? Ele tem algum cheiro específico (bom ou mau)?

#### Voz

Quando o NPC fala, como é a sua voz? Você não precisa imitar uma voz toda vez que falar como esse NPC, ,as falar aos jogadores "Esse elfo fala como um pirata" ou "Esse anão tem uma voz aguda com falsete" ajuda a lembrar e diferenciar esse NPC de outros.

#### Comportamento

Quais comportamentos notáveis esse NPC tem? Talvez ele mantenha contato visual constante ou raramente tira os olhos dos próprios pés. Ele pode cutucar o nariz, repetir um bordão, falar consigo mesmo, roer as unhas, sussurrar sempre que falar algo profundo (ou profano!) ou um pigarro constante. Dar a um NPC só uma dessas distinções ajuda a fixá-lo nas mentes dos jogadores e torná-lo mais autêntico.

#### Falha

Quais falhas de caráter esse NPC tem? Ele pode ser egoísta quando se trata de dinheiro, ignorar higiene pessoal, mentir para cobrir inseguranças ou agir covardemente em frente a qualquer perigo. Uma única falha é suficiente. Falhas demais e o NPC irá de autêntico a autenticamente desagradável bem rápido.

#### Ajudando os Heróis

Por que esse NPC quer ajudar os heróis durante essa aventura? Ele não precisa estar totalmente de acordo com ajudar os heróis a princípio. Pode ser necessário algum convencimento na forma de um Teste, Negociação ou outra tarefa que os heróis precisem cumprir para ter a ajuda desse personagem. Mas provavelmente já existe pelo menos um núcleo de motivação no NPC - ou então ele não tem motivo pra ajudar. Pode ser que ele não queira o sucesso do vilão, pode ver uma oportunidade lucrativa em ajudar os heróis ou pense que deve um favor aos heróis por uma aventura anterior.

#### Negando Ajuda

O que impede esse NPC de ajudar os heróis? É possível que a resposta seja "nada", mas a maioria das pessoas terá algo ou alguém que não estão dispostos a arriscar, mesmo que o destino do mundo esteja em risco. O que o vilão poderia ameaçar que faz o NPC pensar duas vezes antes de ajudar os heróis? Pode ser um ente querido, um local importante ou um tesouro valioso.

### Locais Interessantes

Uma boa aventura tem locais interessantes que os heróis visitam. Esses locais não precisam ser fantásticos para serem interessantes (embora não seja ruim colocar um ou dois lugares fantásticos em uma aventura). Uma pequena vila de fazendas pode ser um local interessante se há eventos envolventes e intriga acontecendo. Até pequenos dramas, como quem envenenou as plantações da fazendeira Yelena ou qual mulher o pastor Jon irá pedir em casamento são os tipos de eventos que tornam um local mais envolvente.

Faça uma lista dos diferentes locais que os heróis podem visitar durante a aventura, incluindo locais genéricos e locais de aventura específicos.

#### Locais Genéricos

Um local genérico é uma vila ou região selvagem definida que os heróis podem visitar durante a aventura.

Se a aventura é em uma metrópole gigante como Capital, então diferentes distritos de cidade e grandes marcos, como catacumbas e parques, contam como locais genéricos. Se a aventura ocorre em uma área regional maior do que uma cidade, mas não maior do que um planeta, então povoados inteiros e biomas como desertos e florestas são locais genéricos. Se a aventura ocorre pela Timescape (ou um meio similar com diversos mundos), então um local genérico pode ser um mundo inteiro ou quaisquer povoados específicos ou biomas que os heróis visitem naquele mundo.

Você não precisa definir tudo sobre esses locais porque você terá mais detalhes sobre os locais específicos que os heróis poderão visitar em qualquer local mais tarde. Você pode usar as perguntas a seguir sobre cada local genérico como um ponto de partida para o que você irá cobrir (e você pode já ter feito partes disso ao criar uma área inicial durante o preparo da campanha):

**Clima**: Qual o clima desse local? É perigoso e pacífico? Sombrio e pesado? Tenso e perigoso? Os cabelos de sua nuca se arrepiam quando você está aqui ou é o tipo de lugar onde se pode relaxar?

**Sentidos:** Quais são as primeiras coisas que você percebe sobre esse lugar com seus sentidos? O que você vê, escuta ou cheira? Qual o gosto do ar? Qual a sensação dele na sua pele? O que se destaca e é único entre as coisas que você percebe?

**Criaturas:** Quais criaturas não-hostis podem ser encontradas aqui? Podem ser transeuntes, comerciantes de rua, animais ou coisas desconhecidas se movendo nas sombras.

Ter esses detalhes ajudará a estabelecer cenas conforme os heróis viajam por esses locais genéricos para chegarem a um ou outro local específico.

#### Locais Específicos

Um local específico é um local onde uma cena da aventura ocorre. Pode ser uma construção, complexo de prédios, rua ou quarteirão de cidade, uma clareira de floresta, um oásis, uma ponte e afins. Os encontros de combate e outras cenas na aventura ocorrem nesses locais específicos.

Ao criar um local específico, faça as seguintes perguntas além das perguntas que faria sobre um local genérico:

- Por que os heróis viriam aqui durante a aventura?
- Que tipos de cenas podem ocorrer nesse local?
- Quais NPCs com os quais os heróis podem interagir podem ser encontrados nesse local?
- Quais informações, itens ou confrontos os heróis podem descobrir aqui que ajudarão a avançar na aventura?

### Planeje Cenas

Uma vez que tenha seu vilão, objetivo da aventura, NPCs e locais genéricos e específicos, é hora de começar a amarrá-los para criar cenas. Sua aventura terá encontros de combate, Testes de Montagem, Negociações, Descansos e cenas de exploração e interação social. A seção "Criando Cenas" a seguir tem mais informações sobre detalhar as cenas de suas aventuras, mas planejar essas cenas é o primeiro passo.

Quando estiver pensando em cenas, escreva quais locais e NPCs estão envolvidos nessas cenas, para então organizá-las em uma ordem que faça sentido para a história. Pode ser que depois do seu evento desencadeador, algumas cenas possam ocorrer em qualquer ordem. Por exemplo, se o objetivo da aventura é recuperar três peças de um antigo cajado antes do vilão, os heróis podem conseguir explorar os três locais onde o cajado está escondido em qualquer ordem que preferirem. Sua escolha pode até ter consequências. Pode ser que o primeiro local que escolham não tem nenhum dos lacaios do vilão ainda, o segundo tem um conflito com esses lacaios e o terceiro já foi saqueado pelo vilão quando chegam lá! Outras cenas podem precisar ocorrer mais linearmente. Uma investigação tipicamente inclui um rastro de pistas que leva heróis de uma cena até a próxima, mas os jogadores podem lhe surpreender.

Não se case com a ordem planejada de cenas. Se os heróis tiverem azar com os dados em alguns encontros de combate, eles podem parar para descansar e restaurar seu Vigor e Recuperações antes do que você imaginava. Se os heróis estão desvendando um mistério, eles podem fazer deduções inesperadas que permitem pular uma de suas cenas ou locais! Isto é parte da diversão do jogo. Os dados e jogadores vão lhe surpreender.

Abrace essa imprevisibilidade mantendo uma mente aberta conforme planeja suas cenas e permita-se ser flexível. É provável que um encontro de combate que os jogadores pularam durante uma sessão possa ser ajustado e reaproveitado em outra sessão, então não se preocupe. O jogo é mais recompensador para você e para os outros jogadores se você deixar que as escolhas e ações dos heróis signifiquem algo e afetem o jogo.

Uma vez que todas as suas cenas estejam planejadas, é hora de juntá-las em um esboço de aventura.

### Esboço da Aventura

Seu esboço da aventura é um documento que você pode usar para dirigir suas sessões de jogo. Ele contém informações sobre o vilão, o objetivo da aventura, NPCs, locais e cenas. Você pode formatar esse esboço como quiser, como frases escritas por completo, listas, uma rede de eventos ou qualquer outra coisa que faça sentido para você.

O esboço de aventura padrão contém informações gerais sobre o vilão, objetivo e NPCs. Depois disso há uma lista de locais e locais de aventura, com locais específicos descrevendo os detalhes de cada cena que ocorre ali. O esboço então encerra com uma seção de conclusão discutindo o impacto das ações dos heróis na campanha geral e no mundo do jogo.

### Criando Cenas

Ao preparar cenas para uma ventura, tenha em mente que **você não pode e não deve tentar controlar como os heróis interagem com os desafios de uma cena**. Como Diretor, muito da diversão do jogo vem de ver os jogadores resolvendo os desafios propostos de forma criativa, usando os recursos e habilidades dos heróis. Você deve planejar obstáculos para os personagens sabendo que podem pensar em soluções que você não pensou. Deixe que testem essas soluções e veja para onde a história vai!

É melhor preparar cenas como: "Aqui está a situação quando os heróis chegam". O mundo do jogo é um cenário autêntico. Quer os heróis apareçam, quer não o façam, bandidos ainda saqueariam, políticos ainda trairiam e tempestades de areia ainda soprariam pelo deserto. Cada cena deve começar com a pergunta: "O que está acontecendo quando os heróis chegam?"

Depois de preparar sua cena, faça uma lista dos elementos narrativos que os heróis podem descobrir ou conquistar naquela cena que irão avançar a história da aventura. Ao dirigir o jogo, você permitirá que os jogadores abordem a conquista dessas coisas da maneira que preferirem. Entretanto, você pode ter algumas ideias de como cumpririam esses objetivos, como quais testes podem fazer para achar pistas ao redor do cadáver que levam a um assassino ou uma possível Negociação para obterem passagem segura através do mar. Anote essas possíveis soluções e quaisquer regras que precisa preparar o uso durante o preparo de suas cenas.

Nem tudo que os heróis fazem é digno de uma cena e você não precisa realizar aventuras em tempo real. Se eles quiserem andar de uma fazenda a um castelo, você não precisa interpretar a caminhada a menos que seja divertido para você e seus jogadores ou algo significativo aconteça ao longo do caminho (como um ataque de bandidos ou descoberta de um corpo). Você não precisa narrar cada ida ao mercado ou viagem de barco se essas cenas seriam entediantes. É um jogo! Dirija as cenas que são divertidas para você e que avancem a história, assim seus jogos serão melhores.

### Fichas do Diretor

Fichas do Diretor são um recurso que você pode usar para preparar e monitorar o progresso de personagens durante encontros de combate, Negociações e Testes de Montagem. Essas fichas permitem que você monitore os objetivos e números relevantes ao desafio, como o Vigor de inimigos, Interesse e Paciência de NPCs, além do número de sucessos e fracassos em um Teste de Montagem. Cada ficha tem uma segunda página opcional que permite monitorar detalhes narrativos, potenciais recompensas e NPCs secundários na cena.

### Criando e Dirigindo Combate

Há muito o que dizer sobre criar e preparar ótimos encontros de combate para _Draw Steel_. Tanto que tivemos que colocar todas as sugestões em outro livro - o que tem todos os monstros e outras coisas que você precisa para construir encontros de combate. Dê uma olhada em _Draw Steel: Monstros_.

Uma dica que notaremos aqui (e que também está no outro livro porque é válido repetir) é que encontros de combate devem ter peso narrativo. _Draw Steel_ não é um jogo de atrito, onde alguns combates triviais podem enfraquecer os heróis para gastarem recursos e tornar o conflito épico, final e importante contra o vilão um esforço ainda maior. Um encontro rápido de combate com dois guardas em um portão provavelmente acaba em menos de uma rodada e não deve dar uma Vitória aos heróis. Essas podem ser cenas divertidas de interpretar, mas não farão uso total das capacidades dos heróis e devem ocorrer apenas ocasionalmente. A maioria das vezes quando combate ocorre, os riscos para os heróis e para a história devem ser altos!

### Criando e Dirigindo Exploração

Cenas de exploração são momentos dirigidos pela narrativa onde os heróis investigam seus arredores para avançar a história ou descobrir recompensas. Tudo desde vasculhar o local de um assassinato por pistas até desvendar ruínas antigas para um portal até Axiom, o Plano da Lei Suprema, é uma cena de exploração.

Ao dirigir cenas de exploração, seu trabalho é definir a cena, ouvir os jogadores descrevendo as ações de seus heróis e então responder com como essas ações afetam o ambiente.

#### Informações Necessárias e Desnecessárias

Ao preparar uma cena de exploração, você desejará escrever suas respostas às seguintes perguntas:

- Quais informações ou objetos os heróis precisam recuperar nessa cena que irão ajudar a avançar a história do jogo?
- Quais informações extras e outras recompensas eles podem obter nessa cena se explorarem totalmente e com sucesso?

As informações ou objetos que os heróis precisam da cena de exploração para avançar a história devem ter uma forma de serem encontrados sem um Teste. Só de entrar na cena do assassinato de um monarca, os heróis podem aprender que um rei foi assassinado com uma faca, porque seu corpo e arma ainda estão completamente visíveis. Eles devem também perceber que a faca tem o brasão de uma família nobre, dando um caminho óbvio para continuar a aventura. Outros detalhes na sala podem acelerar a investigação de quem matou o rei, mas eles encontram de graça o mínimo necessário para continuarem.

Tudo bem que um Teste seja a _melhor_ forma de conseguir as informações necessárias. Mas se os heróis falharem ou não fizerem o Teste, garanta que há outro caminho - provavelmente um mais difícil - para continuar a história. Ao vasculhar a torre de um necromante por um livro que ajudará a parar um ritual, os personagens podem perder todas as pistas que apontam para o livro. Mas eles podem depois encontrar os aprendizes do necromante, que sabem onde o livro está - e não estão dispostos a dar essa informação sem uma luta difícil.

Outras informações e recompensas que os heróis podem ganhar em uma cena de exploração podem estar escondidas atrás de Testes que podem ser falhados ou perdidos. Se os heróis não pensarem em olhar embaixo da mesa do rei morto, eles não encontram o cálice que rolou até ali. Se eles encontrarem o cálice, mas falharem em um Teste de Razão para examiná-lo, eles não aprendem que há resíduos de um veneno raro, potencialmente levando-os até um alquimista próximo que vende o veneno. Eles ainda conseguem resolver o mistério sem essa informação, mas levará mais tempo. Entretanto, quanto mais tempo levar, mais tempo o assassino tem para se preparar para sua chegada, então perder esses detalhes tem consequências!

Uma vez que tenha sua lista de informações e objetos que os heróis podem encontrar, faça uma lista de onde e como essas coisas podem ser encontradas. Algumas podem precisar de um Teste. Algumas podem precisar apenas que o jogador descreva uma certa ação do herói, como vasculhar uma estante ou mesa. Mas enquanto você anota o que é necessário para encontrar informações ou objetos, não tente cobrir todas as opções. Mesmo que o faça, os jogadores vão pensar em coisas com seus múltiplos cérebros que você jamais poderia pensar e você terá que julgar essas escolhas em cima da hora. Saber onde e como informações e objetos estão escondidos ou guardados dos heróis é mais importante do que saber como eles vão obter essas coisas. Se você consegue pensar em pelo menos uma maneira e estiver aberto a outras possibilidades, os heróis têm uma chance justa.

#### Definindo a Cena

Quando uma cena de exploração começa, descreva aos heróis o que eles percebem ao seu redor. Começar com o que os heróis enxergam é uma boa ideia, mas todos os personagens têm outros sentidos. Mencione o que podem cheirar, ouvir e sentir no ambiente se for aplicável ao que estão investigando. Esses pequenos detalhes podem ajudar os jogadores a imaginar melhor a cena e levá-los a momentos narrativos importantes ali. Antes de dirigir a cena, escreva esses detalhes para que você possa descrevê-los logo no começo em vez de tentar improvisar no momento.

Você não precisa listar cada detalhe em um ambiente. Isso leva a jogadores passando muito tempo interagindo com os elementos do ambiente que você só incluiu para caracterização e pode levar você a falar coisas como "Sim, eu sei que descrevi as tapeçarias por cinco minutos, mas realmente não tem nada nelas. Agora, a pilha de ossos no meio do chão, por outro lado..." Muitos jogadores também perderão o foco com muitos detalhes, mesmo que você dê uma narração digna de um Oscar. Em vez disso, limite-se às partes do ambiente que são dignas da atenção dos personagens.

Como um exemplo, se os heróis estão explorando um esconderijo abandonado de bandidos em uma caverna para acharem informações sobre para onde os bandidos foram, você pode descrever uma pilha de dejetos no canto da caverna, um chão molhado de lama e os restos fumegantes de um fogo apagado. Por que apontar essas coisas? Porque a pilha de dejetos tem um mapa rasgado para o novo esconderijo dos bandidos, o chão com lama significa que os bandidos deixaram alguns rastros que podem ser seguidos e os restos de fogo significam que pelo menos alguns deles saíram há pouco tempo, então podem ainda estar no caminho até o novo esconderijo. Você deu aos personagens e jogadores três elementos importantes para interagir, cada um dando informações que podem usar para avançar a história ou ter uma ideia do futuro próximo. Você não precisa descrever as estalactites no teto ou o som do vento assoviando na entrada da caverna ou a pilha de madeira perto da fogueira ou as lesmas rastejando nessa pilha. Embora um ou dois desses detalhes possam ser atmosféricos, detalhes demais irão distrair os jogadores e quebrar a imersão do jogo. Em vez disso, você pode preencher esses detalhes secundários conforme os jogadores fazem perguntas e exploram o ambiente.

#### Heróis Investigam

Depois de definir a cena de exploração, deixe que cada jogador faça perguntas sobre o ambiente e descreva como o herói interage com os arredores. Se um jogador fizer uma pergunta que seu herói não saberia a resposta, você pode encorajar explorar. Por exemplo, se um jogador cujo herói está na entrada da caverna perguntar "O que eu vejo na pilha de dejetos?", você pode responder "De onde você está, parece uma pilha de lixo com roupa e ossos, mas pode ter algo a mais se você vasculhar." Isso encoraja que os jogadores sejam mais ativos no processo de investigação.

Permita que a investigação dos heróis conduza a ação. Em uma cena de exploração, você deve assumir o papel de ambiente, reagindo às escolhas dos personagens e jogadores. Não diga aos jogadores o que seus heróis fazem. Em vez disso, descrevas as consequências de suas ações. Se personagens passarem um tempo para cuidadosamente procurarem armadilhas no esconderijo, eles devem ter uma chance de encontrar quaisquer armadilhas que você colocou ali. Mas se um herói corre para dentro da caverna e aciona uma armadilha escondida porque ele não teve cuidado em território hostil, isso é culpa dele! É uma lição importante que o o jogador deve lembrar para a próxima vez.

> **Os Jogadores Vão Surpreender-lhe**
>
> Até as aventuras mais preparadas raramente sobrevivem ao primeiro contato com os heróis. Suas notas de sessão esperam que os jogadores façam seus personagens entrarem no esconderijo dos bandidos por uma entrada secreta nos fundos, mas um jogador tem a brilhante ideia de entrar através de uma rachadura no teto. É perfeitamente aceitável fugir do roteiro e adaptar aos planos dos jogadores se isso for divertido para todos.
>
> Isso não quer dizer que tudo bem que os heróis ignorem o esconderijo dos bandidos totalmente e saiam a procura de cultistas em outro lugar. Mas enquanto os jogadores estiverem participando do espírito da aventura, adaptar-se ao inesperado é provavelmente a maior diversão que você terá em dirigir o jogo.

#### Quando Usar um Teste

Os heróis podem geralmente conseguir informações básicas só de interagirem com o ambiente. Se um jogador perguntar "Parece que o chão de lama prenderia nas botas de alguém?", ter uma confirmação não precisa de um Teste. Porém, seguir as pegadas que saem da caverna até o novo esconderijo dos bandidos precisa de um Teste, porque essa é uma tarefa mais difícil cuja falha significaria que os bandidos têm tempo para preparar uma emboscada para quando os heróis chegarem! Se um personagem quer investigar meticulosamente a pilha de dejetos e examinar cada resto de lixo, nenhum Teste é necessário para encontrar o mapa rasgado, a menos que esteja sob um limite de tempo para fazer isso. Entretanto, um personagem juntando todas as partes do mapa precisa de um Teste de Razão para juntar as peças, porque falhar nisso significa que os heróis obtém apenas informação incompleta ao continuar sua investigação.

Capítulo 9: Testes explica Testes em detalhes e fornece exemplos de dificuldades diferentes para Testes. Muitos outros jogos de fantasia reflexivamente pedem por um lançamento de dados a qualquer hora que um herói tenta fazer algo. Entretanto, _Draw Steel_ gira em torno da ideia de que o Diretor pede por Testes apenas quando o fracasso tornaria a história mais interessante para os heróis e não pararia o jogo totalmente. Você pode acabar pedindo por menos Testes do que está acostumado - e esta é a maneira como o jogo deve ser jogado!

Além disso, se um jogador tem uma ideia particularmente esperta e plausível para superar um desavio, você pode deixar ele ter um sucesso automático na tarefa, mesmo se a falha tornaria a história mais interessante. É importante recompensar ideias espertas de vez em quando para que jogadores sejam encorajados a pensar fora da caixa e criem momentos memoráveis!

Em contraste, às vezes um jogador irá propor algo que ele acha plausível ou inteligente, mas você não vê como isso pode funcionar. Tudo bem dizer ao jogador "Isso não vai funcionar." Você não tem obrigação de permitir que um jogador realize um Teste para algo que vai falhar automaticamente.

#### Dificuldade de Testes

Testes em _Draw Steel_ têm três níveis de resultados, com todos os jogadores sabendo esses resultados e os lances de dados que resultam neles. Fazer um Teste sempre significa algo porque todos os Testes possuem riscos! Antes de pedir um Teste, você precisa definir uma dificuldade de fácil, médio ou difícil para o Teste.

Um herói sempre terá sucesso em um **Teste Fácil**. É só uma questão de caso terá uma consequência ou recompensa juntamente com o sucesso. Por este motivo, você deve usar esses Testes raramente em suas aventuras.

Um herói com modificador de +1 ou mais no Teste provavelmente terá sucesso em um **Teste Médio**. Sucesso com uma consequência é comum para heróis se o bônus no Teste for menor do que +4, então terão sucesso com um custo. Provavelmente a maioria dos Testes será deste nível de dificuldade. Eles dão as heróis uma chance decente de sucesso sem serem uma certeza e as coisas podem ficar interessantes quando consequências ocorrem.

**Testes Difíceis** são exatamente o que parecem. Você só pode ter um sucesso com um resultado de 17 ou mais, o que significa que um herói só tem uma chance acima de 50% se tiver um bônus de pelo menos +6 no Teste. No 1º Nível, isso significa usar a maior Característica, uma Perícia e ter uma Vantagem. Falhar em Testes Difíceis geralmente significa consequências além do mero fracasso, então é bem arriscado! Você provavelmente verá que Testes Difíceis não são tão comuns quanto Médios, mas ocorrem mais do que Testes Fáceis.

#### Definindo a Dificuldade Durante o Jogo

Ao pedir um Teste, você pode informar a dificuldade do Teste ao jogador. Dizer "Faça um Teste Difícil de Razão" pode ser um momento dramático na mesa, com todos segurando a respiração para ver se o resultado é um sucesso, fracasso ou fracasso com consequências maiores.

Por outro lado, não compartilhar a dificuldade de cada Teste com os jogadores permite mexer um pouco na dificuldade se você quiser. Você pode pedir um Teste e achar que não é necessário quando o jogador lançar os dados. É fácil simplesmente dizer "Ei, perdão. Eu não devia ter pedido um Teste. Você só faz a coisa." Mas se quiser ser legal, lembre que todo nível de um Teste Fácil é um sucesso. É só uma questão de ter ou não uma consequência ou recompensa. Se um herói obtiver um 11 ou menos no Teste e você acha que ainda merecia ter sucesso, então a dificuldade era fácil.

#### Resultados de Testes

Depois que um herói faz um Teste, cabe a você narrar e decidir o resultado, mantendo em mente algumas orientações básicas.

Se um teste é uma **falha com consequência**, o herói não só falha - ele torna as coisas piores. Ele pode chamar a atenção de inimigos próximos, acionar um perigo ou armadilha, sofrer dano, causar dano a um aliado, ter uma Desvantagem em um Teste futuro, perder um objeto Mundano, deixar um NPC amigável irritado ou até lhe dar um pouco de Malícia para o futuro. A consequência é decisão sua!

Se o teste é uma **falha**, o herói não faz o que queria. Mas mesmo que não haja uma consequência formal, efeitos negativos ainda podem acompanhar Testes fracassados dependendo das circunstâncias. Se um herói tenta se mover silenciosamente perto de um grupo de guardas, uma falha no Teste pode atrair a atenção dos guardas, mas o personagem deve ter uma chance de reagir antes de acionarem o alarme. Mas se o personagem tivesse uma falha com consequência, ele seria visto imediatamente e os guardas correriam para atacar.

Se o teste é um **sucesso com consequências**, o herói tem sucesso, mas sofre um efeito negativo significativo. Ele pode se esgueirar pelos guardas, mas perde seu cinto no processo, forçando-o a decidir se volta para pegar o equipamento ou segue em frente.

Se um teste é um **sucesso**, o herói faz o que queria! Você pode até deixar que o jogador narre o resultado perguntando "Como você fez isso?"

Se um teste é um **sucesso com recompensa**, o herói faz o que queria - e mais além. A recompensa pode ser permitir que outro herói tenha um sucesso automático na sua vez de fazer o teste, uma Vantagem em um teste futuro, revelar um Tesouro escondido, inspirar um NPC próximo a ajudar ou ganhar um Vale Heroico para o grupo. A recompensa é decisão sua para criar ou escolher.

Alguns exemplos de consequências e recompensas para Testes estão detalhadas em Capítulo 9: Testes.

### Criando e Dirigindo Perigos

Perigos incluem armadilhas e perigos naturais como areia movediça e avalanches, mas também perigos sobrenaturais, como ruínas com radiação mágica ou nuvens de energia psiônica instável. Perigos podem aparecer em cenas de combate e exploração como perigos que um herói precisa lidar enquanto resolve outros problemas. Um perigo elaborado pode ser uma cena por si só também, seja resolvido em um Teste de Montagem, seja com rondas como se fosse um combate.

Um bom perigo representa uma ameaça real aos heróis e fica no caminho de algo que querem. Atravessar um lago de lava não é um problema se os heróis puderem simplesmente andar ao redor. Mas se o lago for grande demais para isso ou o Tesouro que o grupo procura estiver no fundo do lago, agora ele é algo que não pode ser ignorado facilmente.

Os perigos que você criará e usará em suas aventuras pode ser de três tipos:

**Ativado Perpétuo:** Um perigo ativado perpétuo pode ser ativado por um fio, um som alto, uma placa de pressão ou outro mecanismo que responda às ações dos heróis. O perigo então fica ativo até ser resolvido, como uma armadilha de lâmina pendular que é acionada por um fio e então fica balançando sobre uma ponte.

**Ativado Uso-único**: Um perigo ativado de uso-único é ativado e então cria um momento de perigo. Às vezes esse perigo acaba tão rápido quanto inicia, como uma armadilha que dispara um único dardo venenoso. Outras vezes, esse momento de perigo pode criar problemas duradouros que os heróis precisam resolver, como um desmoronamento de uma caverna que causa dano e deixa o grupo preso em uma mina abandonada.

**Obstrução:** Obstruções são perigos que os heróis precisam contornar, como piscinas de ácido, desfiladeiros e rios de lava. Como esses perigos tendem a ser estáticos, um herói só sofre dano deles como resultado de um Teste falho em uma tentativa de atravessar o perigo.

> **Terrenos como Perigos**
>
> Alguns dos melhores perigos são as opções de terrenos em _Draw Steel: Monstros_. Essas opções dinâmicas funcionam bem em um encontros de combate, mas você também pode usar muitas delas como perigos que os heróis precisam atravessar (como lagos de ácido e lava) ou lidar (como o obelisco negro) enquanto viajam de um lugar ao outro. Você pode usar esses perigos como são ou ajustá-los para combinarem com sua história. Por exemplo, você pode tornar o lago de ácido um lago de veneno ao substituir o Dano de Ácido por Dano de Veneno.

#### Gatilhos de Perigo Ativados

Todos os perigos ativados têm algum tipo de gatilho e os heróis devem poder fazer Testes - tipicamente de Razão ou Intuição - para perceber e desativar o gatilho. Quanto mais letal o perigo, mais difícil o Teste.

Se um herói não pensar em procurar por um gatilho antes de encontrar um perigo, você ainda pode pedir um Teste para que ele perceba o gatilho quando o perigo estiver prestes a ativar, desde que isso faça sentido. Se um herói está prestes a romper um fio que ativa um armadilha, você pode pedir um Teste de Intuição para que ele percebe o fio no momento em que pode ser claramente visto. Em caso de falha, o personagem rompe o fio e ativa a armadilha.

Uma vez que um gatilho seja percebido, os heróis podem ter uma chance de desabilitá-lo, se isso for possível. Você provavelmente não pode fazer nada além de reconstruir uma mina antiga para impedir que ela caia caso as paredes sofram dano, mas você pode desabilitar uma runa mágica que teletransporta quem pisa nela para o meio do oceano. Lembre que tentar desativar e falhar em fazer isso pode ativar o perigo!

#### Dano de Perigo

O dano causado por um perigo depende de dois fatores. Primeiro, quão letal você quer que o perigo seja? Você quer que ele só cause um pouco de dano ou deve custar uma ou duas Recuperações? Segundo, esse perigo é perpétuo ou ocorre apenas uma vez? Se é uma obstrução, responda a essa pergunta pensando se você espera que uma criatura seja razoavelmente capaz de sofrer dano da obstrução mais de uma vez. Se a resposta é sim, considere-o um perigo perpétuo em termos de dano. Se não, é um perigo de ocorrência única.

Um herói pode ter uma chance de mitigar dano de um perigo, como um Teste de Agilidade para fugir ou desviar de uma avalanche ou Teste de Razão para resistir ao dano psíquico de uma nuvem psiônica. Você pode decidir que tipo de Teste precisa ser feito com base nas circunstâncias.

As Tabelas de Letalidade de Perigos de Uso-único e de Letalidade de Perigos Perpétuos mostram o dano causado por perigos. Perigos são organizados por Nível, indicando sua ameaça relativa comparada ao Nível dos heróis. Cada exemplo tem três expressões de dano para resultados de Grau 1, Grau 2 e Grau 3 no Teste feito para reduzir o dano do perigo. Quanto pior o resultado do Teste, maior o dano.

#### Tabela de Letalidade de Perigos de Uso-único

| Nível | Nada Letal | Pouco Letal | Muito Letal |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | 7/5/3      | 9/7/5       | 11/9/7      |

| 10    | 14/11/7    | 19/16/12    | 24/21/17    |

#### Efeitos de Perigos

Alguns perigos causam efeitos além de ou em vez de dano. Um perigo que é parte de um encontro de combate pode impor quase qualquer efeito, incluindo Condições, e pode ter um impacto real na história. Entretanto, se os heróis estão enfrentando um perigo fora de combate, você precisa que quaisquer efeitos impostos sejam mais impactantes e duradouros. Os efeitos a seguir refletem as consequências interessantes e duradouras que um perigo fora de combate deve ter:

- Um personagem perde uma Recuperação.
- Uma maldição deixa um personagem com uma voz demoníaca que dá Desvantagem em Testes de Presença.
- Um personagem sofre um ferimento aberto que causa 1d10 pontos de dano sempre que tiver um 2 Natural ao lançar dados antes do próximo Descanso.
- Um personagem é teletransportado para o meio de um corpo de água próximo.

Mas embora consequências duradouras e interessantes sejam divertidas, tenha certeza de que isso não desvie da história ao ponto do jogo inteiro passar a ser sobre resolver problemas criados por um perigo - a não ser que seu grupo pense que isso é divertido!

### Criando e Dirigindo Interações

Cenas de interação são similares a cenas de exploração, exceto que os heróis obtém as informações e objetos que precisam ao falarem com um ou mais NPCs em vez de explorando uma área. Assim como um encontro de exploração, você fará uma lista das informações necessárias que os NPCs podem oferecer livremente aos heróis. Os NPCs podem então ter outras informações ou objetos que podem ser convencidos a fornecer aos heróis se apresentarem um argumento persuasivo, fizerem um favor ao NPC ou tiverem sucesso em um Teste.

Cenas de interação não são Negociações completas, as quais são reservadas para conversas que podem mudar uma aventura. Ainda assim, tenha em mente que NPCs diferentes podem reagir de maneira diferente a formas distintas de persuasão. Um covarde pode ser fácil de intimidar, enquanto um soldado experiente pode ser impossível de impressionar com exibições de ferocidade. Um suborno pode funcionar com um nobre corrupto, mas uma rainha bondosa que já tem riquezas inimagináveis provavelmente não tem interesse em quaisquer riquezas que os heróis possuam.

Consulte os detalhes que escreveu para seus NPCs ao interpretá-los. Tenha em mente quaisquer comportamentos ou atitudes distintas que puder incluir para tornar a cena divertida. Você não precisa ser um grande ator para criar uma cena de interação memorável! Simplesmente descrever como um NPC parece, soa e age já faz muito mesmo sem fazer vozes engraçadas. Se quiser fazer uma voz, vá em frente - mas não há obrigação nenhuma.

### Criando e Dirigindo Negociações

Quando estiver preparando uma Negociação (veja o Capítulo 11: Negociação), você vai querer escolher um NPC e dar a ele atributos de Negociação - um Interesse e Paciência iniciais, Motivações e Implicâncias, além de uma Opinião. A Tabela de Atitudes Iniciais no capítulo de Negociação deve dar uma ideia de onde começar com alguns desses atributos, mas sinta-se livre para ajustar os números conforme achar necessário.

Ao criar atributos de Negociação, mantenha as seguintes orientações em mente:

- Quanto mais alto o Interesse inicial de um personagem, mais provável que os heróis terminem a Negociação com tudo que querem - e mais ainda - do NPC.
- Quanto mais alta a Paciência inicial do personagem, mais tempo e mais chances os heróis terão para fazer argumentos. Se você quer uma Negociação mais longa, dê ao NPC uma Paciência maior.
- Quanto mais Motivações um NPC tem, mais provável que os heróis tenham Testes mais fáceis ao fazerem argumentos.
- Quanto mais Implicâncias o NPC tiver, é mais provável que os heróis tropecem em assuntos que comprometam a Negociação. Entretanto, muitas Implicâncias podem fazer os jogadores sentirem que a Negociação foi injusta, especialmente se eles não tiveram tempo para analisar o NPC antes de iniciar a Negociação.

#### Planeje os Resultados

É útil saber de antemão os vários resultados que um NPC pode oferecer durante uma Negociação. A continuação de uma aventura ou campanha nunca deve depender inteiramente do resultado de uma Negociação. Você não quer que a história pare por completo se os heróis falharem em obter informações, Tesouros ou ajuda de um NPC. Pode ser que a aventura fique muito mais difícil para eles, mas eles ainda devem ter opções para continuar quando suas habilidades de Negociação falharem.

Uma Negociação tem seis resultados possíveis, mas dois desses são pré-determinados. Se uma Negociação terminar com o NPC em Interesse 4, então os heróis conseguem o que queriam. Se a Negociação encerrar em Interesse 1, então o NPC não oferece nada. Mesmo com quatro opções totalmente abertas, entretanto, preparar resultados requer menos preparativos do que você pode imaginar.

> **Múltiplos NPCs**
>
> As regras de Negociação giram em torno da ideia de que os heróis estão encarando um único NPC dominante - um líder poderoso, um chefe diplomata, um general, um vilão importante e afins. Mas isso não quer dizer que não é possível dirigir uma Negociação onde os heróis interagem com um grupo de NPCs, cada um com formas ligeiramente diferentes de negociar.
>
> Se você preparar uma Negociação com mais de NPC, você não precisa dar para cada NPC um conjunto de atributos de Negociação, Motivações e Implicâncias. Em vez disso, você dá atributos para o grupo como um todo, para então fazer NPCs diferentes tomarem a iniciativa na Negociação quando uma Motivação ou Implicância em particular surgir. Por exemplo, se você der a Implicância de Ganância para um grupo de cavaleiros, o capitão bem-vestido pode até parecer aberto a um suborno, mas quando o sargento carrancudo, ressentido com o estilo de vida extravagante do capitão, rejeita a oferta dos personagens, o capitão precisa concordar para manter a paz entre os membros do grupo.

Se uma Negociação acabar com o Interesse do NPC em 2 ou 5, você precisa saber o que o NPC pode oferecer aos heróis em vez de ou em adição ao que eles pediram. É uma boa ideia também ter uma lista de dois favores, objetos, informações ou outra ajuda que o NPC pode oferecer aos heróis, para que você não precise improvisar algo quando esses resultados surgirem.

De igual maneira, se o Interesse do NPC terminar em 3, ele pedirá aos heróis um favor em troca do que está sendo pedido dele. Os heróis podem também perguntar diretamente ao NPC o que pode ser oferecido para facilitar a Negociação. Neste caso, é bom ter em mente dois favores, objetos, informações ou outra ajuda que o NPC pode pedir aos heróis.

Finalmente, se os heróis realmente ofenderem o NPC e terminarem a Negociação com Interesse 0, pense em algo que o NPC possa fazer para punir os heróis. Se você não tiver isso preparado, porém, não se preocupe. Vingança é um prato que se come frio - e talvez daqui a algumas sessões - então você tem tempo para planejar.

#### Atributos de Negociação de Heróis

Muitos heróis têm recursos de Classe, Títulos ou outras opções de personagem que os tornam melhores em Negociações. Ao preparar uma Negociação, é melhor que você saiba o Renome de cada herói e quaisquer recursos que tenham que possam impactar a Negociação, como o recurso de Parceiro de Cena do Trovador. Pergunte a seus jogadores se alguma das opções de personagem influencia Negociações no início da campanha e pergunte novamente toda vez que subirem de Nível.

#### Heróis Devem Iniciar

Uma Negociação sempre deve ser iniciada pelos heróis e o personagem (como pessoas, no geral) não pode ser forçado a negociar por algo que não quer. Enquanto preparar sua Negociação, lembre que os jogadores podem decidir ganhar o que os personagens precisam do NPC de outras maneiras - pedir um favor de alguém diferente que tem como ajudar, roubar o que precisam do NPC, simplesmente continuar sem a ajuda do NPC, etc.

#### Estrutura para Interpretação

Novos Diretores e jogadores podem se sentir um pouco sobrecarregados com Negociação, pensando se precisam das regras para interpretar uma discussão de troca de favores. Se você prefere jogar sem as regras de Negociação, vá em frente! Os designers de _Draw Steel_ não vão entrar na sua casa e tomar seus livros de você. Entretanto, as regras de Negociação existem para fornecer mecânicas robustas que criam uma dinâmica emocionante entre dois grupos, com riscos altos e drama.

O Interesse de um NPC pode ajudar a determinar a atitude dele em relação às propostas do grupo, enquanto sua Paciência indica quanto tempo está disposto a dar aos heróis. Da mesma maneira que Vigor informa quando um monstro está acabado na luta, Paciência informa quando um NPC cansou de conversar e está pronto para fazer uma oferta. As regras de Negociação significam que você nunca precisa só interpretar uma conversa até que você e os jogadores fiquem entediados com a cena, para que então alguém faça um único Teste para ver o que acontece. As regras de Negociação permitem interpretar com estrutura, riscos e recompensas!

A coisa mais importante a se lembrar a respeito de Negociação é que as regras devem existir para ajudar você - não para atrapalhar. Elas são flexíveis de propósito. Se um herói fizer um argumento excelente que você acha que deve funcionar sem um Teste, então é isso o que acontece. Se um herói faz um argumento infeliz que deve falhar, então azar o dele. Você tem o poder para dirigir uma Negociação da forma que for mais divertida para você e seus jogadores.

Se os jogadores estão com dificuldade em interpretar durante uma Negociação, tente fazer sua próxima Negociação sem anunciar que os personagens estão agora fazendo uma Negociação. Simplesmente peça Testes quando for apropriado e faça o NPC responder baseado nos resultados dos Testes, além de suas Motivações e Implicâncias. Esta abordagem pode ajudar seus jogadores a parar de focar nas regras e passar a apenas interpretar enquanto você monitora o Interesse e a Paciência.

#### Pesquisa e Reconhecimento

Se os jogadores quiserem negociar com um NPC e os heróis têm algum tempo antes da conversa começar, eles podem fazer um pouco de pesquisa e reconhecimento a respeito do NPC, esperando descobrir suas Motivações e Implicâncias. Personagens têm múltiplas formas de lidar com isso. Eles podem pesquisar a respeito do NPC como um projeto de tempo livre, eles podem fazer um Teste de Montagem para buscar rumores ou podem fazer favores a pessoas próximas do NPC para receber a informação.

Sempre é uma boa ideia deixar que os heróis façam um pouco de reconhecimento antes de pular para uma Negociação. Fazer isso torna a história mais rica e pode ajudar os jogadores a engajar mais com o sistema de Negociação, uma vez que estarão mais preparados para ela.

#### Interpretando Negociadores

Quando for a hora de interpretar um personagem em uma Negociação, lembre que o NPC, como todas as criaturas sapientes, é complexo. Cada NPC tem sua maneira própria de abordar uma Negociação. Alguns podem ser cheios de bravado. Outros podem dizer tudo com um sorriso, até quando rejeitam os heróis. Outros podem ser muito eloquentes, enquanto outros podem dizer o mínimo possível para manter os heróis na dúvida sobre seus reais interesses. Como um ponto de partida para pensar em como um NPC específico negocia, verifique suas anotações sobre o NPC que criou ao preparar a aventura, revisando sua voz, comportamentos e falhas, além de quaisquer motivações para ajudar ou negar os heróis.

Uma decisão importante para fazer de antemão é pensar no quão direto o NPC será sobre o que quer dos heróis. Um NPC direto pode tornar uma Negociação rápida, se os heróis estiverem dispostos a dar ao NPC o que ele quiser. Um NPC misterioso pode ser um quebra-cabeça a desvendar e pode ser mais difícil de interpretar. Se é sua primeira vez usando as regras de Negociação, comece com um personagem mais direto antes de interpretar um cliente tímido.

Durante a Negociação, deixe que os jogadores conversem livremente sobre sua estratégia se isso combinar com o estilo de jogo e senso de diversão deles. Você pode intervir se algum problema pessoal surgir, mas, fora isso, deixe que os jogadores planejem, conspirem e adivinhem enquanto você só observa.

Uma vez que a Negociação comece, eles só podem obter informações sobre o NPC fazendo Testes, usando os recursos dos personagens ou através de conversas com o NPC. Sempre que o NPC fizer uma oferta aos heróis depois de um Teste, torne os termos da oferta muito claros. Embora alguns NPCs possam falar de forma misteriosa, é melhor que os jogadores entendam no que estão se metendo. Pode ser divertido enganar os heróis, mas muitos jogadores não acham divertido quando eles são enganados.

> **Compartilhando Interesse e Paciência**
>
> Cabe a você como Diretor decidir compartilhar o Interesse ou Paciência de um NPC durante uma Negociação. Às vezes compartilhar essa informação pode tornar um encontro mais dramático, com os jogadores observando seu progresso ir e vir em tempo real. Outros grupos podem achar Negociação mais divertida, dramática e imersiva se os números exatos ficarem escondidos, assim como alguns grupos gostam de saber o Vigor de cada criatura em uma batalha e outros preferem que essa informação seja segredo. Fale com seus jogadores sobre o que eles preferem.

### Exemplos de Negociadores

Esta seção contém vários exemplos de NPCs que você pode usar para Negociação, ordenados conforme o valor de suas Opiniões. Cada um desses NPCs é um arquétipo que você pode adaptar facilmente para situações específicas. Por exemplo, o Chefe de Quadrilha pode ser o líder de uma gangue, um capitão pirata ou um rebelde que redistribui riqueza ao roubar os nobres corruptos para distribuir os bens aos menos afortunados.

Cada arquétipo inclui uma lista de Motivações e Implicâncias que um NPC pode ter. Você deve escolher pelo menos duas de cada lista para qualquer NPC que criar usando o arquétipo. Sinta-se livre para mudar a descrição das Motivações e Implicâncias ou ajustar os números conforme adequado.

#### **Chefe de Quadrilha - Opinião: 1**

_O chefe de quadrilha é um valentão e fanfarrão, com a maioria negociando com intimidação e bravado antes de amolecer._

**Motivações**
O chefe de quadrilha pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Liberdade**: ninguém me fala o que fazer - não se quiserem manter a cabeça em cima dos ombros. E ninguém diz aos meus lacaios o que fazer, exceto EU!
- **Ganância**: ouro! Eu amo a sensação de moedas tilintantes e brilhantes nas mãos. Eu nunca achei nada para comprar que eu gostasse mais do que ter o ouro em si.
- **Poder**: eu quero um esconderijo mais forte, mais lacaios e maior parte dos espólios. Arranje isso e eu faço seu trabalho sujo. Você pode ficar com seus títulos e terras.
- **Folia**: se você não ficar bêbado depois de uma batalha, então por que ter uma batalha?

**Implicâncias**
O chefe de quadrilha pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Autoridade Superior**: por ordem do barão? Pode ficar com seus títulos chiques e terras. Eu dou as ordens aqui!
- **Justiça**: só os fracos pedem justiça. Os fortes fazem suas próprias regras.
- **Legado**: olha, não ligo pro que acontecer quando eu morrer. Eu quero que meus lacaios gritem meu nome agora, não daqui cem anos.
- **Paz**: em tempos de paz, você pega uma moeda que não é sua e o xerife vem bater na sua porta. Na guerra, caravanas inteiras desaparecem e ninguém liga. Prefiro a guerra.

#### **Cavaleiro - Opinião: 2**

_Embora não seja um idealista, o cavaleiro é um servo leal do seu senhor e segue as regras. O cavaleiro sabe seu lugar na sociedade e acredita que todos devem ficar no seu lugar._

**Implicâncias**
O cavaleiro pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: essas pessoas não precisam de caridade, elas precisam de ordem. Deixe irem até o conselho e elas terão sua fome saciada em troca de um dia de trabalho honesto.
- **Liberdade**: ninguém é livre, desde o mais baixo servo até em cima. Até um monarca tem um dever com seu povo.
- **Poder**: meu poder vem do meu juramento, não de um acordo feito em segredo.
- **Vingança**: eu acredito em justiça, não vingança, e ordem é decidida pelas cortes. Eu sou apenas um funcionário.

#### **Mestre de Guilda - Opinião: 3**

_O mestre de guilda sabe o valor do dinheiro, mas entende que conhecimento - tanto informação privilegiada quanto segredos de ofício - é a moeda mais valiosa que existe. Ele barganha de acordo._

O arquétipo do mestre de guilda pode ser usado para qualquer fonte de informações locais, como líder de um culto, bruxa ou espião.

**Motivações**
O mestre de guilda pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: o povo não pode cuidar de si mesmo. Alguém tem que cuidar deles, pobrezinhos.
- **Descoberta**: seria altamente antiético que você me mostrasse esses esquemas de uma guilda rival. Da mesma forma, seria altamente antiético lhe dar essa bolsa com dinheiro.
- **Poder**: quem você pensa que estará no comando na próxima era? Os nobres? Bah! Eles ainda contam riqueza em vacas. Não, quem controla informação irá mandar no mundo - e eu pretendo estar lá.
- **Proteção**: nós temos rivais - oportunistas gananciosos que não param por nada. Se eu quiser proteger minha guilda, tenho que acabar com eles antes que acabem conosco.

**Implicâncias**
O mestre de guilda pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Autoridade Superior**: minha lealdade é com a guilda - não com o prefeito, não com o rei, nem com o próprio Ajax. Mas não diga a eles que eu disse isso.
- **Justiça**: estamos moldando o mundo aqui. Claro, algumas pessoas que não conseguirem se adaptar vão ficar por baixo. Mas por que alguém nos culparia por isso?
- **Paz**: conflito não ruim por si só. Ele gera inovação. A chave é não estar do lado dos perdedores.
- **Folia**: eu não tenho tempo para tolices. Venha falar comigo de novo quando tiver algo de valor para me mostrar.

#### **Chefe Militar - Opinião: 4**

_O chefe militar ergueu seu estandarte e tropas vêm à sua causa. Alguns dizem que eles nunca negociam, mas isso não é verdade. Eles ficam felizes em ouvir os termos de uma rendição._

O arquétipo do caudilho pode ser usado para qualquer ameaça local, como um vampiro, chefe hobgoblin ou nobre rebelde.

**Motivações**
O chefe militar pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Liberdade**: eu não vou pagar nenhuma moeda a um senhor fracote pelo privilégio de mandarem no que faço. Eu ergui meu estandarte. Eu desafio qualquer um a derrubá-lo.
- **Legado**: você viu aquela jovem capitã ali colocando o medo dos deuses nas tropas dela? Aquela é minha filha, mas ela mereceu o título. Algum dia isso tudo será dela.
- **Paz**: olhe ao seu redor. Para onde quer que olhe - fraqueza, corrupção, desperdício. Paz é um objetivo nobre, mas não teremos paz até que o regime atual seja derrotado.
- **Vingança**: você sofreu como eu nas mãos daquele vilão? Então eu alegremente lhe chamo de amigo.

**Implicâncias**
O chefe militar pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: vá para sua esquina e peça esmola se é isso que quer. Você não conseguirá nenhuma comigo.
- **Descoberta**: o que isso tem a ver comigo? Sou um soldado, não um sábio.
- **Justiça**: você ousa me chamar de injusto? Eu faço as leis aqui. A justiça é minha para dar ou tirar!
- **Proteção**: não sou um covarde que implora por proteção e minhas tropas também não são. Quem quer que peça por segurança não a merece.

- **Justiça**: a lei deve ser preservada. Se você tiver provas de algum crime, os responsáveis devem ser punidos.

**Implicâncias**
O burgomestre pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Descoberta**: confie em mim. Nada de bom virá de cutucar esse vespeiro em particular.
- **Liberdade**: liberdade, hein? O que vem depois, liberdade de impostos? Ninguém nasce livre exceto os deuses e só tolos pensam de outra forma.
- **Folia**: guarde essa garrafa. Eu sou uma figura pública! Não posso ser visto festejando e pulando e fazendo sabe mais o que.
- **Vingança**: na política, é necessário ter uma memória ruim. Seu inimigo hoje pode ser seu aliado amanhã. Não há necessidade de tornar as coisas pessoais.

#### **Virtuoso - Opinião: 6**

_O virtuoso é o músico preeminente da região - talvez uma cantora de ópera famosa ou compositor. Se você precisa popularizar uma causa ou sujar o nome de um inimigo, então é a ele que você vai._

O arquétipo do virtuoso pode ser usado para qualquer outra celebridade local, como um mestre artesão, artista inspirado, gladiador famoso ou campeão mundial.

**Motivações**

- **Legado**: castelos ruirão. Impérios cairão. Mas se eu produzir uma obra digna de meus talentos, meu nome viverá para sempre.
- **Paz**: na guerra, estátuas de bronze são derretidas para fazer armaduras. Dinheiro é gasto em balistas em vez de baladas. Guerra é um crime contra o deus da arte.
- **Folia**: sim, festejemos esta noite! Inspiração olha com gentileza por aqueles que bebem da vida até a última gota.

**Implicâncias**
O virtuoso pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Ganância**: você me oferece dinheiro? Dinheiro vai até os gênios - nos é devido. Eu consigo isso com milhares de admiradores.
- **Poder**: não tenho ambições além deste teatro de ópera. Deixar este lugar, mesmo por um palácio ou trono...seria um exílio para mim.
- **Proteção**: não tenho medo. A deusa da música cuida dos seus.
- **Vingança**: talvez existam alguns que me odeiam...alguns que pensam que estou no caminho ou cujas conquistas ofusquei. Mas não odeio nem tenho inveja de ninguém.

#### **Alto Sacerdote - Opinião: 7**

_O alto sacerdote pode ser um membro com cargo alto na sua fé, mas, como ele lhe dirá rapidamente, ele não é livre para fazer o que quiser. Os comandos de sua divindade são supremos._

O arquétipo do alto sacerdote pode ser usado para qualquer autoridade nacional, como conde, juiz ou general.

- **Justiça:** fique tranquilo que os bons receberão sua recompensa e os maus serão punidos. Eu garantirei isto.

**Implicâncias**
O alto sacerdote pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Ganância**: não me ofereça isso. Doe para a fé, se você não tem outro uso para isso.
- **Legado**: eu? Não sou ninguém. Meus bons atos, se tenho algum, são crédito de minha divindade, não meus.
- **Poder**: minhas responsabilidades atuais bastam. Não tenho desejo de mais.
- **Folia**: que vergonha! Você se gaba de fazer o mal e espera que eu participe?

#### **Duque - Opinião: 8**

_Conforme o duque faz um gesto para que se junte à mesa dele, espiões sussurram no ouvido dele. O duque nunca joga um jogo ou entra em uma negociação a menos que pense que pode ter a carta mais alta._

O duque pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: você pensa que sou o que sou por amar meu povo? Metade deles são tolos e a outra metade são vilões. Mas sem eles, eu seria o Duque de Nada, então devo preservá-los.
- **Ganância**: guarde seu ouro. Sou ocupado demais para gastá-lo.
- **Justiça**: certo e errado? Não há certo, exceto o que fortalece o reino, e não há errado, exceto o que o danifique.
- **Proteção**: não ligo para salvar vidas. Todos estamos condenados a morrer. A questão é o que viverá depois de nós.

#### **Dragão - Opinião: 9**

_O poder tremendo do dragão é ofuscado apenas por sua ilimitada ambição e orgulho._

#### **Monarca - Opinião: 10**

_Sejam bons, sejam maus, monarcas estão acostumados com autoridade - e querem mantê-la. Eles respondem melhor a pedidos do que exigências._

**Motivações**
O monarca pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: não é por nada que me chamam de "o Bom".

**Implicâncias**
O monarca pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Vingança**: vingança é um esporte excitante. Infelizmente, é um que deixei para trás. É política, não vingança, que governa aqui.

#### **Lich - Opinião: 11**

_O lich passou séculos sozinho, estudando e acumulando seu poder...mas agora a hora de estudar acabou._

O lich está disposto a negociar com heróis poderosos que podem se tornar tenentes leais - ou servos mortos-vivos poderosos se as negociações não forem boas.

_A divindade escutará suas orações - e talvez até responda a elas, se tiver vontade de fazê-lo._

O arquétipo da divindade pode ser usado para qualquer poder que transcenda o mundo, como o lendário dragão do tempo Cthrion Uroniziir ou o faraó terrível Khorsekhef, o Infinito.

- **Benevolência**: não se preocupe, pois enviei campeões para salvar o mundo. Talvez esses campeões...estejam mais próximos do que você pensa.
- **Legado**: quando este abençoado dia chegar, todos virão a mim para rezar e oferecerei minhas bençãos ao mundo!
- **Poder**: embora onipotente no reino espiritual, minhas mãos estão atadas para questões tão mundanas. Mas se agir por mim, posso oferecer assistência.
- **Proteção**: tenha fé, pequeno...ninguém será esquecido ou deixado para trás.

-

### Criando e Dirigindo Testes de Montagem

Você pode usar Testes de Montagem para perseguições, fugas, investigações viagem em regiões inóspitas, rastrear outras criaturas e qualquer momento excitante na história que possa ser contado com transições ou cortes entre os heróis.

#### Preparando Testes de Montagem

Ao preparar um Teste de Montagem, você precisará escrever algumas informações importantes.

Primeiro, faça uma lista de potenciais desafios que os heróis enfrentam durante o Teste de Montagem. Esta lista de desafios deve ser pelo menos tão longa quanto o número de sucessos que os heróis precisam para ter sucesso total. Você pode também preparar uma lista de consequências e recompensas que podem surgir para Testes individuais feitos durante o Teste de Montagem, mas como você não pode prever as abordagens dos jogadores para os Testes, não se preocupe em cobrir cada cenário. Você sempre pode usar ganhos de Malícia ou dar Vales Heroicos como consequências e recompensas padrões (veja Resultados de Testes no Capítulo 9: Testes).

Então você precisará criar três resultados para o Teste de Montagem: sucesso total, sucesso parcial e fracasso total. Em um sucesso total, os heróis devem conseguir tudo o que queriam. Em um sucesso parcial, eles devem conseguir o que queriam, mas pagando um preço, criando um novo problema para si depois de fazer o que queriam ou não conquistando exatamente os objetivos que queriam. Em um fracasso total, eles falham em conseguir o que queriam, mas isso não pode impedir a história. Talvez tenham perdido o rastro dos lacaios em fuga, mas sabem que podem invadir a torre de um mago para obter essa informação. Mesmo que a falha possa custar muito a eles, eles ainda devem ter opções para continuar a aventura.

#### Dirigindo Testes de Montagem

Ao dirigir um Teste de Montagem, comece definindo a cena para os jogadores e listando os vários desafios que os heróis devem superar. Permita que os jogadores formem uma estratégia sobre a ordem na qual irão abordar esses desafios e fazer Testes.

Ao julgar os Testes individuais como parte de um Teste de Montagem, faça como faria com qualquer outro Teste (veja Julgando Testes no Capítulo 9). Testes individuais devem ter recompensas e consequências quando apropriado. Além das opções usuais de recompensas ou consequências, você pode escolher que esses resultados deem Vantagem ou Desvantagem em um Teste posterior que faça parte do Teste de Montagem. Faça o que fizer sentido para as ações dos heróis na narrativa.

Depois de cada Teste, descreva as falhas ou sucessos dos heróis de forma que outros jogadores entendam se e como o desafio foi superado. Sua descrição pode até dar novas ideias para o que os personagens podem fazer em seguida.

Se um herói decide abordar um problema usando uma de suas Habilidade, Traços ou outros recursos em vez de um Teste e fizer sentido que o façam, permita o uso. Em muitos casos, você pode tratar essa abordagem como um sucesso automático que permite que o grupo supere um dos desafios do Teste de Montagem, mas você pode decidir que existem consequências desse sucesso. Outra opção é que o uso de uma Habilidade ou Traço é benéfico o suficiente para dar uma Vantagem em um Teste futuro ou tão efetivo que conte como múltiplos sucessos ao ponto de resolver o Teste de Montagem de uma vez só! Sempre recompense ações espertas dos jogadores.

No fim do Teste de Montagem, narre o resultado para os jogadores e descreva o sucesso ou falha, além de quaisquer consequências. Então você pode informar que o Teste de Montagem acabou!

#### Reviravolta de Montagem!

Você pode separar os Testes individuais em um Teste de Montagem ao introduzir um encontro de Combate rápido, Negociação, armadilha ou mais desafios a superar na cena. Monitore os sucessos e fracassos dos heróis para decidir quantos Testes precisam fazer antes de introduzir sua reviravolta. Geralmente, uma única reviravolta em um Teste de Montagem pode ser introduzida ao final da primeira ronda de Teste de Montagem. Confirme que os jogadores entendam que o Teste de Montagem está em pausa, mas não foi finalizado. Depois que a reviravolta estiver estabelecida e resolvida, continue com o Teste de Montagem.

### Exemplos de Testes de Montagem

Você pode usar quaisquer dos exemplos de Testes de Montagem a seguir no seu jogo ou usá-los como inspiração para modificar como quiser.

#### Enfrentar Incêndio

Fogo se espalha pelo vilarejo! Os heróis devem prevenir que ele se espalhe mais ainda enquanto salvam o máximo de pessoas possíveis. Seus esforços podem ser mais complicados se a causa do fogo - como um dragão ou exército invasor - ainda estiver por perto.

##### **Definido a Cena**

Fogo se alastra em várias construções e os ocupantes precisam ser resgatados. Em outros locais, algumas pessoas fogem enquanto outras jogam água no fogo sem qualquer organização ou plano. Sem liderança e um jeito de parar o incêndio, o fogo pode facilmente consumir tudo. Em um estábulo próximo, os cavalos entram em pânico conforme a palha começa a arder. Destroços em chamas bloqueiam caminhos por toda parte.

##### **Desafios de Montagem**

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Filas de Baldes**: personagens podem organizar os então bombeiros em brigadas disciplinadas de baldes ou podem combater as chamas de outra maneira. _Características sugeridas_: Presença, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, Intimidar, Liderar.

**Abrir um Corta-fogo**: previna que o fogo se espalhe ao remover materiais inflamáveis, seja movendo-os ou queimando-os de forma controlada. _Características sugeridas_: Músculo, Razão. _Perícias e Habilidades sugeridas_: Resiliência, Levantar, Habilidades com Dano de Fogo. _Especial_: Uma criatura perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio.

**Evacuar Construções:** os personagens precisam salvar pessoas presas em construções em chamas. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Resiliência, Persuadir. _Especial:_ Uma criatura que não tiver Imunidade a Fogo perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio. Os heróis pode tentar esse desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Recrutar mais Bombeiros:** ao encontrar grupos que não estão enfrentando o fogo, como civis em fuga, os personagens podem convencê-los a ajudar. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Intimidar, Liderar, Persuadir.

**Libertar os Cavalos:** os personagens podem soltar os cavalos do estábulo que estão ameaçados pelo fogo e levá-los a um lugar seguro. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Trato Animal, Levantar, Montar.

**Mover Destroços em Chamas:** mover destroços incendiados que bloqueiam passagens podem permitir que pessoas fujam das chamas. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Levantar. _Especial:_ Uma criatura que não tenha Imunidade a Fogo perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio.

**Usar os Cavalos Libertos (se o desafio de Libertar os Cavalos foi bem-sucedido):** personagens podem usar os cavalos para mover destroços ou levar pessoas a locais seguros. _Características sugeridas:_ Razão, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Conduzir, Trato Animal, Montar.

##### **Reviravoltas Opcionais**

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, surge uma emergência. Um ou mais heróis, escolhidos pelos jogadores, devem lidar com a situação até o fim da ronda. Se os heróis lidarem com a reviravolta com sucesso, eles ganham um sucesso no Teste de Montagem. Caso contrário, eles ganham uma falha.

**Colapso de Construção:** enquanto um herói está dentro ou próximo de uma construção, ela começa a ruir. O herói precisa escapar antes que a construção seja destruída. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Causa do Fogo:** ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, surge a causa hostil do fogo - um esquadrão de um exército invasor, um dragão, um grupo de arsonistas, etc. Os personagens devem iniciar um Encontro Padrão ou Difícil contra esta ameaça.

**Socorro!** Aldeões estão prestes a entrar em uma construção em chamas para salvar um parente preso. Esta reviravolta requer dois Testes, cada um dando um sucesso ou falha para o Teste de Montagem. Um herói pode tentar evitar que as pessoas entrem na construção enquanto outro herói resgata o parente. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Levantar, Persuadir.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** o fogo é extingo. Construções estão danificadas, mas nenhuma vida foi perdida. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** o fogo foi apagado, embora muitas construções tenham sido destruídas e algumas vidas tenham sido perdidas. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** quando o fogo finalmente se apaga, a cidade está em ruínas. As pessoas estão de luto por seus mortos ou se preparam amargamente para encontrar um novo lar. Os personagens não recebem Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Infiltrar o Palácio

Estejam os heróis tentando chegar na sala do trono de um tirano, realizar um assalto ousado ou resgatar uma figura da realeza em cativeiro, eles estão onde não deveriam - e gostariam de manter sua presença em segredo.

##### Definindo a Cena

O palácio é bem protegido, com patrulhas externas sempre em alerta. As poucas entradas óbvias são trancadas e vigiadas. Além disso, uma vez que o grupo esteja dentro do palácio, ninguém sabe o caminho até o objetivo. Guardas patrulham o interior do lugar também, forçando os personagens a serem furtivos ou blefarem para criar caminho.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Metade do trabalho de qualquer infiltração bem-sucedida é feito antes de entrar no lugar. Os jogadores podem escolher que os heróis façam Testes individuais como parte do Teste de Montagem antes de tentarem entrar no palácio. Uma ronda de Testes pode ser feita desta maneira, sem que nenhum desses Testes influencie o nível de alarme do palácio (veja a seguir).

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte deste preparo inicial:

**Subornar Guardas:** os heróis podem pagar os guardas externos para que olhem para o outro lado. Se bem-sucedidos, a Riqueza de um ou mais heróis é reduzida em 1 ponto. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Criminalidade, Flertar, Persuadir.

**Encontrar Esquemas:** procurar entradas secretas e passagens pouco conhecidas pode ser feito em bibliotecas esquecidas ou prefeituras bem-vigiadas. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, História, Esgueirar.

**Identificar Entradas Desprotegidas:** olhar os arredores ou consultar contatos pode revelar uma porta dos fundos esquecida ou janela acessível. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Arquitetura, Criminalidade.

**Aprender Rotina dos Guardas:** ao manter seus olhos e ouvidos atentos, personagens podem aprender quando os guardas encerram seus turnos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Bisbilhotar, Rastrear.

**Usar Identidades Falsas:** ao produzir documentos ou insígnias falsificados, personagens podem se preparar para andar pelo palácio a olhos vistos. _Características sugeridas:_ Presença, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Falsificação, Mentir.

Quando os heróis começarem sua infiltração, o nível de alarme do palácio começa em 0. Enquanto se infiltram no local, sempre que um herói falhar em um Teste como parte do Teste de Montagem, o nível de alarme aumenta em 1, até um máximo de 2. Cada vez que os heróis tiverem sucesso em um Teste, o nível de alarme reduz, até um mínimo de 0. Enquanto o nível de alarme for 1, Testes feitos dentro do palácio como parte do Teste de Montagem têm Desvantagem. Quando o nível de alarme for 2, esses Testes possuem desvantagem dupla.

A primeira vez que qualquer herói falhar em um Teste como parte do Teste de Montagem enquanto o nível de alarme for 2, ele encontra guardas e deve iniciar um encontro de combate difícil. A segunda vez que qualquer herói falhar em um Teste com o nível de alarme em 2, o Teste de Montagem resulta em uma falha total.

Os desafios a seguir podem ser parte da infiltração dos heróis:

**Rota Aérea:** os personagens podem seguir um caminho que passa por passarelas ou saliências elevadas. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Evitar Tráfego:** ao buscar as áreas mais empoeiradas, menos utilizadas e ficando nelas, os heróis podem evitar serem percebidos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Navegação, Procurar, Rastrear.

**Ficar Quieto:** uma vez que o nível de alarme esteja acima de 0, os heróis podem encontrar um lugar para ficarem escondidos por um tempo, reduzindo o nível de alarme em 1 ponto. Esta atividade não requer um Teste nem gera um sucesso ou falha.

**Criar uma Distração:** depois de causar uma comoção, os personagens rapidamente seguem para o outro lado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Alquimia, Atuar, Sabotar.

**Fingir de Guardas:** usar uniformes roubados ou preparados de antemão pode permitir que os personagens andem livremente pelo palácio. O Teste para este desafio ganha uma Vantagem se os personagens prepararam disfarces de antemão (incluindo ter sucesso no desafio de Usar Identidades Falsas) ou derrotaram guardas durante sua infiltração. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Mentir, Procurar.

**Ficar nas Sombras:** ficar fora de vista é a forma mais simples para os personagens se moverem pelo palácio. _Característica sugerida:_ Agilidade. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Esconder-se, Esgueirar. _Especial:_ os heróis podem tentar este desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

A qualquer momento durante a seção de infiltração do Teste de Montagem, imediatamente depois do turno de um herói, os personagens podem encontrar outro grupo que também está se infiltrando no palácio e possivelmente estão atrás do mesmo prêmio. Os personagens podem escolher lutar, negociar com o outro grupo, ou deixá-los passar - o que pode significar encontrá-los de novo quando alcançarem seu objetivo final.

##### Resultados de Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis alcançam seu objetivo e asseguram uma rota de fuga que os deixa sair do palácio em segurança. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** os personagens alcançam seu objetivo, mas precisam vencer um encontro de combate padrão para fugir do palácio. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** o palácio entra em alerta total e o objetivo dos heróis fica fora de alcance. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias de combates que ocorreram durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Preparar para Batalha

Seja uma vila ameaçada por bandidos, seja uma grande cidade se preparando para um cerco, inimigos estão a caminho e prontos para atacar. Os heróis têm tempo limitado para fortificar as defesas do local e animar as tropas.

###### Definindo a Cena

As muralhas ou paliçadas ao redor do povoado estão em más condições (se sequer existirem). Estradas ou rios pela área dão aos invasores livre acesso ao povoado a menos que barricadas, armadilhas ou emboscadas sejam preparadas. Suprimentos de comida, armas e munição estão baixos demais para durar um cerco longo. A área é lar de poucos combatentes experientes comparados aos invasores e a milícia local tem poucos equipamentos e experiência.

###### Desafios de Montagem

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Armas e Armadura:** produzir ou reparar armas e armaduras de todos os tipos pode ajudar a recompor os estoques da defesa. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Alquimia, Forja, Flecharia.

**Evacuação:** os heróis podem ajudar os não-combatentes a ficarem seguros antes dos invasores chegarem. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Trato Animal, Liderar, Persuadir.

**Fortificação:** os personagens podem ajudar a construir ou reparar as muralhas ou outras estruturas de defesa. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, Resiliência, Levantar.

**Inspiração:** melhorar o ânimo com discursos inspiradores ou apresentações pode preparar os nativos para a luta que está por vir. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Gabar-se, Liderar, Atuar.

**Propaganda:** os personagens podem tentar semear confusão ou rebelião nas tropas do exército que se aproxima. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Falsificação, Mentir.

**Reservas:** os personagens podem caçar, colher ou conjurar comida e água com magia para aumentar os suprimentos do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Natureza, Esgueirar, Rastrear.

**Treinamento:** os heróis podem ajudar a treinar os defensores do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Intimidar, Liderar.

**Armadilhas:** cavar poços escondidos, colocar obstáculos e preparar emboscadas tornará mais difícil para que os invasores se aproximem do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Ocultar Objeto, Resiliência, Mecânica.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

No final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, uma vanguarda rápida do inimigo ataca antes que os defensores do povoado estejam prontos. Os heróis devem enfrentar um encontro de combate fácil.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos resultados a seguir encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** o povoado é totalmente fortificado e, mesmo que os heróis não lutem em sua defesa, o povo e as estruturas sobreviverão. Se os heróis quiserem, podem deixar o povoado e lutar um encontro de combate padrão contra o líder dos invasores com seus lacaios, possivelmente matando ou capturando o líder. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** as fortificações do povoado foram melhoradas, mas ele não resistirá se os heróis lutarem em sua defesa. Para salvar o povoado, os heróis devem triunfar em um encontro de combate difícil contra o líder dos invasores com seus lacaios. Se os heróis perderem, o povoado é destruído. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os heróis perdem uma Recuperação por seus esforços fracassados em defender o povoado, que é tomado pelos invasores. Se os jogadores quiserem, os personagens podem enfrentar dois encontros de combate difíceis contra ondas de invasores para permitir que alguns dos habitantes fujam em segurança. Os personagens não recebem Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates travados durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Rastrear o Fugitivo

Os heróis estão seguindo os rastros de alguém. Um criminoso fugitivo? Uma fera perigosa? Uma criança perdida ou sequestrada? As dificuldades da perseguição dependem se o alvo sabe que está sendo perseguido e se quer ser encontrado.

##### Definindo a Cena

A rota do fugitivo é fácil de seguir, mas seria essa uma trilha falsa? Será que alguém o viu passar e há qualquer ideia de para onde pode estar indo? O objetivo é que os personagens façam o que puderem para continuar nos rastros do fugitivo.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Perguntar:** personagens podem obter pistas de nativos e transeuntes - ou, se tiverem acesso à magia adequada, dos animais e dos mortos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Interrogar, Persuadir, Boatos.

**Seguir os Rastros:** buscar rastros ou outros sinais da passagem do fugitivo pode levar os personagens adiante. _Característica sugerida:_ Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Procurar, Rastrear. _Especial:_ os heróis podem tentar este desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Ter uma Visão Melhor:** os personagens podem subir a locais altos para ver os arredores de para onde o fugitivo pode estar indo. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Prever o Próximo Movimento:** os heróis podem ter uma ideia de para onde o alvo está indo. Um personagem ganha Vantagem no Teste desse desafio se conhecer bem o alvo. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Navegação, Ler Pessoas, uma Perícia adequada do Grupo de Perícias de Conhecimento (Natureza para seguir um animal, Criminalidade para seguir um criminoso, etc.).

**Marcha Forçada:** enquanto o alvo estiver descansando, os heróis têm uma chance de se aproximar. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Conduzir, Resiliência, Navegação, Montar. _Especial:_ o herói fazendo o Teste deste desafio perde uma Recuperação.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, os heróis encontram uma armadilha ou problema deixado pelo alvo. Isto pode incluir coisas como um poço com estacas envenenadas, um grupo de nativos irados que foram informados de que os personagens são criminosos ou um incêndio provocado. Os heróis precisam lidar com a armadilha ou problema antes que possam seguir com o Teste de Montagem.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos resultados a seguir encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis alcançam seu objetivo antes que o fugitivo chegue a seu destino ou antes que uma criatura sequestrada ou perdida fique machucada. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas de combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** se o alvo estava tentando evitar a captura, ele alcança seu destino. Ele encontra aliados e uma posição fortificada com a qual se defender ou pode ter mais tempo para causar mais dano. Se o alvo estava perdido ou sequestrado, ele está seriamente ferido quando encontrado. Cada personagem ganha uma Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os rastros desaparecem e os heróis precisarão buscar novas pistas ou uma nova abordagem antes de poderem voltar à procura. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas recebem Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Corrida Selvagem

Os heróis precisam atravessar uma área selvagem, talvez para alcançar uma cidade cercada antes que seja invadida ou para buscar o local onde uma maldição está prestes a entrar em efeito. Chegar lá rápido é uma prioridade - mas chegar vivo também é.

##### Definindo a Cena

O território selvagem tem perigos desconhecidos. Os personagens precisam encontrar o melhor caminho enquanto mantém um bom ritmo, ficam de olho em perigos e evitam predadores.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Os desafios a seguir podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Evitar Perigos:** os personagens podem determinar formas de superar os perigos naturais do território, como usar ervas que repelem insetos em um pântano ou fazer sapatos para neve em uma tundra. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Curar, Natureza, uma Perícia adequada do Grupo de Perícias de Criação (como Alquimia para fazer o repelente).

**Carregar Bagagem:** ao carregar os suprimentos para membros mais fracos do grupo, os personagens podem aumentar a velocidade do grupo inteiro. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Levantar.

**Encontrar o Caminho:** evitar se perder é um grande desafio para os personagens. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Natureza, Navegação.

**Manter o Ânimo:** os personagens podem manter o ânimo do grupo durante uma marcha forçada com canções e música. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Liderar, Música, Atuar.

**Manter Vigia:** os personagens precisam ficar de olhos atentos para o perigo. _Característica sugerida:_ Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Bisbilhotar, Rastrear.

**Marcha Forçada:** os personagens precisam estar prontos para aumentar o ritmo e ir além do cansaço. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Liderar, Conduzir, Trato Animal ou Montar, se o grupo tiver montarias ou veículos.

**Bater Terreno:** investigar o caminho adiante permite que os personagens evitem bloqueios e terreno difícil. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Navegação, Esgueirar.

###### Reviravoltas Opcionais

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, a jornada os personagens é interrompida por uma das seguintes ameaças:

**Monstro Predatório:** os personagens encontram ou são perseguidos por um predador monstruoso, devendo iniciar um encontro de combate padrão para superar a ameaça ou afugentá-la. Se algum personagem teve sucesso no desafio de Bater Terreno, você pode permitir que os personagens façam um Teste em Grupo para passar furtivamente pelo monstro ou preparar uma emboscada.

**Perigo Inesperado:** um perigo natural como uma avalanche, deslizamento ou incêndio interrompe a jornada. Cada herói deve fazer um Teste de sua escolha para evitar o perigo, perdendo uma Recuperação em caso de falha.

###### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis chegam ao seu destino a tempo. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** para alcançar seu destino a tempo, os heróis devem correr muito na última porção da jornada, com cada personagem gastando 2 Recuperações para fazê-lo. (Se sequer um personagem não tiver 2 Recuperações sobrando, os personagens sofrem uma falha total no Teste de Montagem). Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os heróis não chegam a tempo de evitar a catástrofe. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

### Dirigindo Descansos

Quando os heróis decidem fazer um Descanso (veja Descanso no Capítulo 1: O Básico), seu papel como Diretor muda um pouco. A maioria das atividades dos heróis durante descansos envolve projetos de tempo livre, que são tipicamente direcionados pelos personagens. Entretanto, você ainda tem alavancas que pode puxar para tornar a história interessante.

#### Lugar Seguro

Heróis não podem realizar um descanso a menos que estejam em um lugar seguro. Isso tipicamente significa um lugar com uma cama, quatro paredes e um teto sobre suas cabeças, onde provavelmente não serão atacados enquanto dormem. Os personagens não terão 24 horas de paz para realizar um descanso no covil de um vilão, mesmo que travem uma porta. Entretanto, isso pode se tornar uma área nebulosa se os heróis tentarem fazer um descanso enquanto viajam por terras selvagens.

"Por que não podemos acampar nessa Silva aparentemente pacífica por um dia?" é o tipo de coisa que você pode decidir que é aceitável se quiser que os personagens possam restaurar Vigor e Recuperações. Por outro lado, você pode querer que trabalhem mais duro por isso e marcar a Silva como um local perigoso na história. Se os jogadores querem que os heróis descansem em um local que você definiu com inseguro, deixe saberem que é impossível ter qualquer descanso significativo ou progresso em projetos porque estão constantemente vigiando por sinais de perigo.

#### Muitos Descansos?

Cabe aos jogadores decidir quantos descansos os heróis fazem consecutivamente. Personagens animados para fazerem uma longa série de descansos a fim de avançarem projetos de tempo livre (Capítulo 12) é aceitável, mas eles sempre devem sentir alguma pressão para voltar à luta. Lembre que vilões não param de conspirar e conquistar enquanto os heróis descansam. Seus planos continuam! Se os heróis estão levando o tempo que quiserem com descansos para que possam criar quantas Poções de Cura quiserem, faça que saibam das últimas ações malignas que os vilões estão realizando. Heróis querendo defender o povo e os valores que amam precisam parar de descansar e começar a aventurar.

Se você prefere uma campanha com poucos descansos, você pode querer adicionar artesãos, sábios e origens de projeto para permitir que heróis tenham chance de criar itens úteis ou fazer pesquisa, uma vez que seu tempo para isso será limitado.

#### Eventos de Projeto

Eventos de projeto de tempo livre são a hora do Diretor brilhar durante o tempo livre. Lembre que esses eventos (detalhados no Capítulo 12) são opcionais e você pode usá-los com a frequência que quiser. No geral, mais de um ou dois por descanso pode ser disruptivo à campanha. Tudo bem não ter eventos se você só quiser que a história principal da campanha siga em frente.

Ao dirigir eventos de tempo livre, garanta uma rotatividade de quais heróis estão no holofote da ação. Não concentre no mesmo herói várias e várias vezes. Você também pode fazer alguns preparativos para eventos antes de jogar, lendo a sugestão de evento e dando detalhes para virar uma cena. As sugestões são intencionalmente vagas para que você possa modificá-las como quiser ou criar as suas próprias com facilidade.

#### Descansos entre Sessões

Se seu tempo de jogo é limitado, você pode fazer com que os jogadores façam tudo que precisam fazer durante um descanso entre as sessões de jogo, desde que terminem uma sessão fazendo um descanso. Fazer isso permite dirigir quaisquer eventos por email ou um aplicativo de conversas. Enquanto, quando todos voltarem para a próxima sessão, estarão prontos para partir, com lançamentos de projeto concluídos, experiência calculada, além de Vigor e Recuperações restaurados.

#### Quantos Descansos?

Não há número certo de descansos que funciona para todos os grupos. Se você quiser que os personagens sejam capazes de criar e pesquisar, você precisará dar mais tempo livre para que o façam. Se prefere dar todos os Tesouros e segredos através de aventuras, então precisarão de menos descansos. Um bom ritmo para a maioria dos jogos é que os heróis façam entre 10 e 20 descansos a cada Nível de jogo, com vários desses descansos em sequências.

##### Vitórias e Descansos

No final das contas, os jogadores, não o Diretor, decidem quando os heróis realizam um descanso. Então mesmo que você julgue se as condições são seguras o bastante para um descanso, esta parte do ritmo da história está efetivamente fora de suas mãos. Tipicamente, a maioria dos heróis quer descansar depois de cerca de 4 a 6 Vitórias que recebem, dependendo de quantas Vitórias foram recebidas em encontros de combate.

#### Regra Opcional: Lançamento Médio

Quando os jogadores fizerem uma longa série de descansos, pode não ser divertido para que os jogadores façam vários lançamentos de dados cobrindo muitos projetos. Em vez disso, você pode calcular o progresso de cada descanso como se o herói tivesse obtido um 11 Natural no seu lançamento de progresso, para então adicionar os bônus adequados. Embora lançar muitos dados e torcer por Avanços possa ser bem divertido, obter a média do lançamento de 2d10 permite que jogadores passem por muito tempo livre com apenas o mínimo de matemática.

#### Regra Opcional: Criação Mais Fácil

Todo Projeto de Criação requer que um herói obtenha o item pré-requisito e uma origem do projeto em um idioma específico antes que o projeto possa ser iniciado. Esses requisitos existem para que você possa controlar o ritmo com o qual os heróis podem criar um arsenal de tesouros e outros itens ao mudar as regras para exigirem apenas o item pré-requisito ou origem do projeto, mas não ambos, ou ao remover as restrições de idioma em origens de projeto. Isto funciona bem em campanhas que não têm muitos descansos. Apenas tenha em mente que remover essas barreiras pode levar os heróis a fazerem mais itens e desequilibrar o jogo em favor deles.

### Concedendo Recompensas

Dar Tesouros, Renome, Riqueza e Títulos aos personagens deve ser tão divertido para você quanto receber essas recompensas o é para os jogadores (veja Capítulo 13: Recompensas). Mas qual a quantidade certa de Tesouro a dar sem tornar os heróis durões absolutos que podem simplesmente derrubar qualquer dragão que encontram? Com qual frequência as regras do jogo esperam que um herói receba Renome? E Títulos? Esta seção tem respostas para você!

### Concedendo Tesouros

Quando estiver planejando dar Tesouros aos heróis, concentre-se em itens que são úteis. Encontrar um arco mágico não vai ser muito excitante para um grupo que não tem um herói que adore combate com armas à distância. Os jogadores podem até falar (ou você pode perguntar) quais Tesouros seus heróis mais querem.

Uma vez que tenha Tesouros em mente, você pode usar a progressão a seguir como uma base para que os heróis recebam esses Tesouros:

- Um grupo deve receber dois Tesouros com Nível por herói até o 10º Nível. Alguns heróis precisam de apenas um Tesouro com Nível para ficarem felizes, então se você achar que outro Tesouro com Nível não ajudaria o personagem, você pode trocar esse item por um Adereço adequado ao Escalão do personagem.
- Um grupo deve receber um Adereço por herói por Escalão. Qualquer Adereço recebido deve ser do Escalão do personagem ou abaixo.
- Um grupo deve também receber de um a três Consumíveis de seu Escalão ou menor a cada Nível.

Você não precisa dar todos esses Tesouros aos heróis - especialmente para aqueles que estão usando seu tempo livre para criar coisas! Você pode intercalar o ritmo no qual personagens recebem Tesouros ao entregar origens de projeto e itens de pré-requisito para criar um item em vez de encontrar o objeto diretamente.

Ao planejar uma aventura, coloque os Tesouros e materiais de criação que os heróis podem ganhar no esboço do aventura (veja Criando Aventuras anteriormente neste capítulo). Inimigos que têm acesso a Tesouros que podem ajudá-los contra heróis não mantém esses Tesouros escondidos. Eles os usam em combate e os heróis vitoriosos podem então obter esses Tesouros!

##### Tesouros Acima de 1º Nível

Para uma campanha onde os heróis começam no 2º Nível ou acima, você pode dar a esses heróis os seguintes Tesouros iniciais:

- No 1º Escalão, cada herói começa com um Adereço de 1º Escalão.
- No 2º Escalão, cada herói começa com um Tesouro com Nível e um Adereço de 1º Escalão.
- No 3º Escalão, cada herói começa com dois Tesouros com Nível, um Adereço de 1º Escalão e um Adereço de 2º Escalão.
- No 4º Escalão, cada herói começa com dois Tesouros com Nível, um adereço de 1º Escalão, um Adereço de 2º Escalão e um Adereço de 3º Escalão.

Os jogadores podem escolher os Tesouros de seus heróis e substituir qualquer Tesouro com Nível ou Adereço por um Consumível do Escalão do herói ou abaixo.

### Criando Novos Tesouros

Você pode facilmente criar novos tipos de Tesouros com Nível para heróis encontrarem usando as melhorias do projeto Imbuir Tesouro no Capítulo 12: Projetos de tempo livre.

Você também pode escolher qualquer um dos Tesouros neste livro e facilmente alterar sua aparência. Você gostaria que as Luvas de Lagartixa fossem botas? Basta mudar a descrição, a palavra-chave Mãos e pronto. Você gostaria que a Marreta Congelante fosse uma adaga que cria poças de ácido em vez de um campo de gelo? Mude a palavra-chave Arma Pesada, troque o tipo de dano e tudo pronto! Simplesmente mudar palavras-chave, dano e descrições de Tesouros não vai quebrar o jogo.

### Concedendo Títulos

Você não precisa dar aos heróis cada Título para os quais se qualificam. Na verdade, você provavelmente não deve, senão eles ficarão poderosos demais rápido demais. Via de regra, um herói deve ganhar um novo Título em Níveis alternados, o que você pode conseguir com uma das opções a seguir:

- Você pode dar a um herói um Título durante um momento significativo em uma campanha, como após derrotar um vilão. Cada um dos heróis recebe um Título escolhido por você.
- Você pode permitir que um herói escolha um Título adequado entre as opções de Títulos disponíveis ao Escalão a cada vez que ele alcançar um Nível de número par.

Você deve falar com seus jogadores ocasionalmente para ver se há Títulos específicos que gostariam de obter, para então dar uma chance de obter esses Títulos. Fazer isso permite que os jogadores se envolvam mais na campanha e torna os personagens mais motivados a se aventurarem.

### Concedendo Renome

Os heróis ganham Renome sempre que fazem algo significativo, como salvar uma cidade ou...bem, salvar o mundo! De modo geral, heróis devem ganhar 1 ponto de Renome por Nível.

Se quiser que os personagens sejam menos famosos do que no conto heroico tradicional, você pode ajustar isso para dar Renome em Níveis alternados. Outra opção é dar Renome depois de cada aventura, se quiser que os heróis se tornem figuras importantes no mundo mais rapidamente.

#### Quantos Militantes?

Você pode definir limites para o número de militantes que os heróis podem ter a seu serviço. Para um grupo grande de heróis, ter muitos militantes pode tornar o combate complexo, longo e atrapalhado. Da mesma maneira, militantes são uma ótima forma de ajudar um grupo menor de heróis a lidar com desafios maiores. De modo geral, é uma boa ideia usar militantes para ajudar os heróis a terem um grupo de pelo menos quatro integrantes, mas não mais do que sete integrantes.

### Concedendo Riqueza

Os heróis ganham Riqueza sempre que forem bem pagos ou recuperarem uma montanha de tesouro. Personagens devem ganhar 1 ponto de Riqueza a cada dois Níveis.

### Concedendo Vales Heroicos

Você pode dar Vales Heroicos aos jogadores por tomarem riscos com seus personagens além do que o jogo tipicamente espera deles. Por exemplo, lutar contra um grupo de monstros é parte do jogo e não merece Vales Heroicos. Entretanto, as atividades a seguir podem merecer:

- Um herói fica sozinho contra um grupo de inimigos para permitir que seus parceiros fujam.
- Um herói voluntariamente pula em area movediça, lava ou perigo similar para salvar outro personagem.
- O grupo tem uma forma fácil de sair de uma situação difícil que envolve mentir, trapacear, roubar ou ações similares, mas escolhem o caminho honroso mais difícil.
- Um herói dá um recurso importante para alguém, como uma Poção de Cura, para ajudar outra criatura necessitada.

### Concedendo Vitórias

Use as orientações a seguir para dar Vitórias aos heróis, aumentando estes valores conforme o desejado para desafios notavelmente difíceis.

#### Encontros de Combate

Um encontro de combate bem-sucedido onde os objetivos do grupo são alcançados concede 1 Vitória a um herói. Encontros particularmente difíceis valem 2 Vitórias quando terminados com sucesso. _Draw Steel: Monstros_ tem mais informações sobre Vitórias e dificuldade de combate.

#### Testes de Montagem

Cada herói ganha 1 Vitória quando tiver sucesso total em um Teste de Montagem fácil ou médio e 2 Vitórias quando tiver sucesso total em um Teste de Montagem difícil. Um herói ganha 1 Vitória se tiver um sucesso parcial em um Teste de Montagem médio ou difícil.

#### Negociação

Cada herói ganha 1 Vitória se o grupo encerrar uma Negociação com o Interesse do NPC em 3 ou mais, com esse Interesse 2 pontos acima do valor no início da Negociação, e com um acordo feito.

#### Perigos e Armadilhas

Se os heróis superarem um perigo ou armadilha complicados que precisaram de múltiplos Testes para encontrar e sobreviver, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Quebra-cabeças

Se os heróis resolverem um quebra-cabeça complicado que você acha que a maioria das pessoas levaria pelo menos 10 minutos para resolver, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Objetivos de História

Se os heróis cumprirem um objetivo importante da história que cumpre uma missão, como salvar um príncipe preso por um barão maligno ou impedir que um necromante realize um ritual devastador, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Esperteza

Se os heróis usarem esperteza para fácil e surpreendentemente superar ou contornar um encontro de combate, uma Negociação, um Teste de Montagem, uma armadilha, um quebra-cabeça ou outro desafio que teria concedido 1 ou mais Vitórias por um caminho mais difícil, dê a cada personagem a quantidade de Vitórias que teria recebido se tivesse enfrentado o problema diretamente.

## Campanha: Primeira Sessão

Ah, o cheiro de campanha nova! A primeira sessão de qualquer campanha de longo prazo é sobre deixar os jogadores empolgados, confortáveis e prontos para jogar. A primeira sessão de uma campanha é às vezes chamada "sessão zero" por conta de seu foco em preparação e criação de personagens - mas quando a criação está feita, você quer garantir que a sessão comece com o máximo de empolgação possível!

### Primeiro, Negócios

No início de sua primeira sessão, você tem alguns negócios para resolver antes de poder entrar na diversão de criar personagens.

#### Agenda

Fale com seus jogadores sobre o agendamento do jogo. Determine com o grupo a frequência de jogo, o que pretendem fazer quando um ou mais jogadores não puderem jogar e como vocês se comunicarão sobre o jogo quando não estiverem jogando.

#### Lidando com Disputas

Converse e decida como resolver disputas a respeito de regras. Nós recomendamos que você tome uma decisão no momento e então procure a regra depois da sessão para manter o fluxo de jogo.

#### Ferramentas de Segurança

Converse sobre as ferramentas de segurança que planeja usar na mesa. Para mais informações sobre ferramentas de segurança e uma lista de ferramentas de segurança que você pode usar em seus jogos, verifique o Kit de Segurança de RPGs de Mesa MCDM em https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit.

#### Proposta de Campanha

Leia sua proposta de campanha novamente (veja o início deste capítulo) e responda quaisquer perguntas que os jogadores tenham sobre ela.

#### Sugestões dos Jogadores

Pergunte aos jogadores o que gostariam de ver na campanha e faça anotações sobre suas respostas. Isso pode incluir qualquer coisa desde "Eu adoraria ter algumas cenas de perseguição!" até "Eu quero explorar temas de perda e luto." Essas sugestões devem ser pontos de partida para uma conversa. Se nem todos os jogadores estiverem confortáveis com certos temas ou conteúdos desejados por outros jogadores, esta é uma ótima hora para discutir isso (voltando à sua discussão de ferramentas de segurança quando apropriado) e encontrar um consenso sobre o que todos querem com o jogo.

#### Regras da Casa

Converse sobre regras da casa que foram acordadas com os jogadores e pergunte se há qualquer regra que gostariam de adicionar. Regras da casa sempre devem ser discutidas com os jogadores, mas, no final das contas, você decide quais são usadas na campanha.

### Crie Heróis

Durante a primeira sessão de uma campanha nova, os jogadores provavelmente passarão a maior parte do tempo criando heróis. Enquanto o fazem, é uma boa ideia que você fique disponível para responder quaisquer perguntas que tenham sobre a campanha e o cenário. Eles podem perguntar sobre tudo desde o nome da cidade onde a primeira aventura começa, organizações importantes no jogo ou se um idioma ou Perícia serão úteis na campanha.

Enquanto seus jogadores criam seus heróis, você pode fazer anotações. É uma boa ideia anotar o nome, Linhagem, Antecedentes, Classe e Complicação (se houver) de cada herói. Também anote quaisquer detalhes importantes do histórico que um jogador compartilhar com você, como a cidade natal do personagem dele, os nomes de rivais, entes queridos, inimigos e quaisquer organizações com as quais se envolveram.

### Comece com um Estrondo

Quando tudo está feito, é uma ótima ideia jogar uma cena inicial durante sua primeira sessão - idealmente uma cena que inclua um encontro de combate. Este primeiro encontro deve dar aos jogadores uma prova da campanha deliciosa que você está cozinhando para eles e deixá-los mais empolgados para a próxima sessão.

Seu encontro de abertura deve introduzir ou dar pistas do vilão que os heróis enfrentarão durante sua primeira aventura. Você pode usar qualquer uma das ideias de encontro a seguir para começar:

- Enquanto viajavam ao povoado onde sua primeira aventura vai ocorrer, os heróis e sua caravana ou navio são atacados por bandidos.
- Os heróis entram em uma nova cidade e encontram Cães de Guerra (veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_) prontos para executar publicamente um nobre que se recusou a obedecer ao tirano brutal Ajax.
- Os heróis estão em uma taberna aproveitando a noite quando um bando de invasores Gnoll ataca e incendeia o local.
- Os heróis estão acampando em um pântano quando mortos-vivos emergem da lama e os cercam.
- Enquanto assistem a uma peça de teatro, um ator (talvez por acidente) realiza um ritual que abre um portal para o Deserto Abissal e invoca uma horda de demônios.

O encontro que você fizer deve ter relação com a primeira aventura que planeja dirigir. Mantenha este encontro simples e deixe que cada jogador se acostume a dirigir seu herói. Você pode sempre ter alguns reforços vilanescos chegando caso o encontro seja fácil demais!

Se ainda tiver tempo sobrando, você pode continuar jogando um pouco mais, podendo expandir o encontro de combate ou adicionar um pouco de exploração ou viagem. Caso contrário, encerre o combate, agradeça aos jogadores por uma ótima primeira sessão e comece a planejar sua próxima sessão.
